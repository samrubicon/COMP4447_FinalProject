Lyrics

V:
Every single nightfall
Is like an alarm
Reminding me of when you were in my arms
Yeah, it still hits me hard

PC:
I’m trying to move on without you
But I just can’t stop thinking bout you
Maybe we were hopeless
And nothing could have fixed it
I wish we had another try, another try
To get it right

C:
Holding on
To every memory
I still feel
A part of you in me
But I want you to know
That I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go

Take me back
To every single night
Dancing down
under the city lights
But I want you to know
That I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go

V:
I still can hear the rainfall
Hitting my car
The night when we drove to California
Yeah, I still need ya

PC:
I’m trying to move on without you
But I just can’t stop thinking bout you
Maybe we were hopeless
And nothing could have fixed it
I wish we had another try, another try
To get it right

C:
Holding on
To every memory
I still feel
A part of you in me
But I want you to know
That I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go

Take me back
To every single night
Dancing down
under the city lights
But I want you to know
That I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go",2,>1000

There’s a scar upon my heart
The wine of desire in my veins
You thought that you were smart
To lock me up in golden chains
But I suffer from the heat of passion and in death I’ll posses you at last 

Guide me back across the lake
For you shall drink bitter tears
You got to give me a break
Remember all those happy years
When you were jealous of a memory that made you a prisoner of the past

I am but a God without a soul
Who spends his life on the dole
And I’m losing control

See where the Lord will lead me
Walk with my head between the clouds
As if I were a refugee
Fleeing away from the madding crowds
Beauty’s but a curse, but as long as I can worship you I’ll kiss the day

Yours is the face I long for
Your wet lips satisfy my thirst
When I take you on a cold floor
I always want it to be the worst
There’s no more shame in me, this is the binding tie and here forever I’ll stay

I am but a God without a soul
Who spends his life on the dole
And I’m losing control

Bless the power that moves me into utter desolation
In the black embrace of loneliness I’ll cry out for your damnation
And if love cannot drown the truth, well it can never win
In the blistering desert, this wilderness of sin

The fury of the sun will put my mind on fire and turn reason into madness

I am but a God without a soul
Who spends his life on the dole
And I’m losing control
They say life is sad, meaningless and hopeless
You fight, you suffer, show your wounds, but you stand
A strange fate they call remorse and illness
You believe, you act, do things different than you planned

There's more pain than pleasure
You're a fool and a laughing stock
Love they call a treasure
Nothing else than a mental shock

But to find you by my side is still a big relief
So lay me down like a stone and wake me like a leaf

Cold and untouchable
Ridiculous and impossible
Misery and joy
Always mama's little boy

To get married is to loose yourself in hate
You drink, fall ill, hope to recover and survive
Crawling like a maggot and a lightweight
You lie, you repent, try to stay away from a knife

You set fire to the mind
Feel lonely and totally lost
Become legally blind
Turn a warm heart into frost

But to find you by my side is still a big relief
So lay me down like a stone and wake me like a leaf

To choose between good and bad
Is to love you more and trust you less
And if it all seems too sad
Time is all that matters I guess

But to find you by my side is still a big relief
So lay me down like a stone and wake me like a leaf
I didn’t fell in love for fun
No, you were just the only one
On a wrong time and a wrong place
It can be worse, so I don’t mind
You being naked and unkind
With a hungry look upon your face

See me standing here like a sleeping horse
Now ain’t that enough for a quick divorce
I’m glad to leave you alone
If you want we can do this over the phone

But you never got to understand
I’m in need of a helping hand
We’re wasting my time and yours 
I ain’t joking and it ain’t fair
To lead me on from here to there
Release me and open the doors

To where bluebirds sing and there’s a whiskey spring
Where I can get drunk and do my own thing
Keep the secrets to myself
And stash away my life on a lonely shelf

I don’t mean to be rude, but I’m not the steady type
You thought I’d be when you saw the time ripe
Sinners like you and me we all march to hell
Cos heaven to us is like a cancer cell 

You have no idea how bad it gets
I really need some safety nets
I can’t stand it anymore
But like all my plans, it’ll come to pass
You know I’m a fool, a real jack ass
It seems we have been here before

Where bluebirds sing and there’s a whiskey spring
Where I can get drunk and do my own thing
Exchange the truth for a lie
Yes, I will be loving you till the day I die
I'm sick of dark churches
Lunacy and death
Nothing human disgusts me anymore
Spooks are coming for me
The stench of bad breath
Telling us to make love and not war

But where is your father when you really need him?
It's pain and panic
Betrayal and despair
How can God be our salvation?
Nothing more than an angry old man
Who puts his head in the sand

In kneeling and declining position
I bend before you
It's like walking barefoot on sharp glass
All tried and true
Tried and true

I'm ready to get steamed
Hacked, stacked and canned
Slowly crossing the border of madness
At the end of my rope
Finally outmanned
To be left alone in eternal sadness

And where is your mother when you really need her?
It's pain and panic
Betrayal and despair
How can God be our salvation?
Nothing more than an angry old man
Who puts his head in the sand

Who puts his head in the sand
I never felt a slave, but still I hardly feel free
God is in every man, divinity only in me
I’ll wash myself in fresh blood

And like a rock I will be your anchor
Into your hands I commit my dreams

It’s a strange and stubborn faith that lets us lead a senseless life
You took the sword out of my hand and replaced it by a cheap knife

And now I’m dying
There are no goodbyes to be said
We must believe in one another instead
Into your hands I commit my dreams

This troubled heart of mine is waiting for relieve
I’ve come to the end of my search, found a way to believe
I’ll rise from your filthy mud

And like a rock I will be your anchor
Into your hands I commit my dreams

You to remember me as I was is the only hope I have left
Don’t disappoint me and swear upon a love swift and deft

And now I’m crying
My intentions pure and true
Death is an answer but I insist upon you
Into your hands I commit my dreams

Yes like a rock I will be your anchor
Like a rock I will be your anchor
		
Into your hands I commit my dreams
Into your hands I commit my dreams
Living in a world of my own
An ambitious plan
I never was a family man
I rather am alone
And lead a quiet life
No happy one as husband and wife

Forgive me for what I am going to do to you
It’ll be there out of the blue

I feel relieved
And also ashamed
I hope you know I’m not to be blamed
It’s a mission I received
A secret thing
Not for my pleasure, it doesn’t make me sing

And you’ll be obsessed by ideas of revenge and hate
Don’t torture me, no, it’s too late

The devil has been haunting me and made me sin in thought
Disguised a perfect love it was my poor soul he sought
How could I be so wrong?

The road to Jesus is through devotion and pain
I must hide myself and not look for you in vain
Get a hold of myself and be strong

Worship, obey me and show me tenderness
Stay true to your heart and love me more or less
Tormented by grief and guilt I’ll remain silent
I won’t wish for death for it’ll come in the end

Living in a world of my own
Living in a world of my own 
Living in a world of my own 
Living in a world of my own
She’s taking a bath in leaves
While I hate swimming pools
Very much prefer the sea
Enjoying the rest and peace
Without the usual fools
A feeling of infinity

No I’m not the person you think I am
But please try and understand
You’re mistaken me with someone else
All because the loss of youth	The loss of youth

She has a smoke or maybe two
While I just sit and bleed
Cos there ain’t no happy end
Not being big enough for you
The power and the greed
I really need to comprehend

Now I know I don’t have that much class
But shove the morals up your ass
You don’t want to listen to what she says
All because the loss of youth	The loss of youth

I’m searching for evidence of who you are
You tried to hit me and I got sore
All it left in my memory is a very deep scar
I’ve got nothing to say to you anymore

She puts a hand between her legs
While I stare into the dark
Have to make this one last call
Tell her till for mercy she begs
She looks like a question mark
Into black water we fall

I only saw her in the summer time
Fed up with murder and crime
The sickening death and the filthy smell
All because the loss of youth	The loss of youth
The loss of youth
Last night I dreamt that you were dead
Waking up I felt like a king in bed
But the stench of fish and dirty rats		
Made me throw up and think of burning bats

Now did you try to kill your only child?
Did you try to hang it while you smiled?
Aw come on, don’t lie and say that you will repent
The soul of a woman is in her scent
The soul of a woman is in her scent

Inspiration requires peace and tranquility
The greatest solitude will teach me the virtue of humility

And all this plans and obsessions
That were in honesty conceived
For always victim of suppressions	
No, they never will be relieved

It’s your perfume that I remember well
It’s what keeps me alive in this prison cell
But it tends to become oh so monotone
Since I seem to have no smell of my own

Now did you betray your only son?
Did you try to threaten him with a gun?
I don’t hate you but my disgust will be oh so well spent
The soul of a woman is in her scent
The soul of a woman is in her scent

Now did you help me in any way?
Did you try to let me see the day?
Aw come on, just admit that you’d hurt me in any event
The soul of a woman is in her scent
The soul of a woman is in her scent

My poor existence may have a higher destiny
Without an odor I will leave no trace in history

The soul of a woman is in her scent
The soul of a woman is in her scent
After four years in the dungeons I’ve come back as I swore I would
Just an outcast without any hope who was much misunderstood
A smashed body full of anger and hate

In this moment of truth and shame you claim that you don’t care
Well look me straight in the face and say it again if you dare
My misfortune was nothing but ill fate

I’m resentful and impatient
What else is there for me to do?

A strange destiny brought me to a new life and a new home
Better to be free than to be chained in an empty pleasure dome
But should half a man not stay on his own?

I shall never feel again but maybe I will learn to love you
There will be traces of vengeance in everything I say or do
A simple choice between violence and peace

You’re either for me or against me and somehow live in fear
You’ll see terrible things in my eyes and quietly shed a tear
While I shall ask you again for a release

I’m resentful and impatient
What else is there for me to do?

Because of the love I lost I’ve got no real purpose anymore
I know that sounds like a coward and I know my excuses are poor		
Aw you better leave me here and let me die alone

Die alone
Die alone
Die alone
Die alone
If you could look inside my soul
You’ll find that it’s obscene
To take you is my only goal 
O sweet Josephine

I can sell sour milk to a cow
Surprise you in the act
To make love to you here and now 
Don’t you overreact

Baby I’m your butcher boy
Born to be your perfect toy
Welcome to the house of the Lord
Let me be the chairman of the board

Can you see yourself in such a bloody fucking place?
Where even in the dark you can’t hide your face

Move and inspire me with your naked thighs
Not even a smile for my pains in your bloodshot eyes

Baby I’m your butcher boy
Born to be your perfect toy
Welcome to the house of the Lord
Let me be the chairman of the board

Baby I’m your butcher boy
Born to be your perfect toy
Welcome to the house of the Lord
Welcome to the house of the Lord
Let me be your chairman of the board
Of the board
I am tired			And full of fever
But maybe that’s a blessing in disguise
Cos I made a promise	That I won’t keep
We both live a life full of dirty lies

Is there something or anything that you’re not telling me?
My love didn’t come with a money back guarantee
It’s your death that will justify my means

You were my home		And knew my secrets
But feeling safe with you I never did
You have failed me		While I lost my faith
You fooled me like I was a stupid git

Wanting perfection seems to have made me blind
A sad example of a tormented state of mind
It’s your death that will justify my means

Now would you tell me what you were doing with that guy?
Did I not trust you and give you everything so tell me why?

I’m not ashamed		Of what I’m gonna do
I’ll cut of your tongue and fry the fresh meat
I’m not courageous		Just simply rude
I’m gonna bury you in concrete

Thank you for your body, it’s a wonderful gift
I’ll love and kiss and cherish it until it’s all stiffed
It’s your death that will justify my means

And all is driven by guilt, but I’ll redeem by doing good deeds
I’m so sorry for your loss, but honey know that my heart bleeds

It’s your death that will justify my means
It’s your death that will justify my means
Forgive me			I didn’t wanna hurt you
I still need you		Need you like a pain in the ass
Please talk to me		And then start crying
I still want you		Want you like a bad looking glass

No don’t call me or maybe use a payphone
Cos I lost my card in the frigid Zone
How about a life without being scared

You got the message		So try to understand
That I am waiting		Waiting for this girl to leave the bar
Now get out			And take this thing with you
Got to have her		Desire her like a used car

I wanna sleep with her and dump her into the sea
Now please won’t you give your mobile to me?
How about a life without being scared

Tender dreams are waiting for fools who wanna believe
Everlasting sorrow for those who don’t wanna grieve

So sell the baby		You can always have another
Don’t come out		No, don’t come out till she’s gone
Do it now			And steal for us instead of her
And we’ll be happy		Yes, we’ll be happy before dawn

Have I ever screwed you now be honest and fair
Now make your mind up if you at least do care
How about a life without being scared

Use no force but shoot her like a piece of meat
Don’t be afraid if you think you can’t stand the heat

How about a life without being scared
How about a life without being scared
Stars, forsake my happiness
Moon, shine my pain
Living evil inflicted me with a blood stain
Sun, light my loneliness
Sky, hold me tight
Embrace me with the warmth of this last gunfight

And as I die I shall be transformed
Become the one I wanted to be, wanted to be, wanted to be

Love, behold this old man
Hate, you were a friend
Forced to abandon you forever in the end
Beauty, you had a plan
Death, you are the best
Now caress me and put these tired eyes to rest

And as I die I shall be reborn
Become the one I needed to be, needed to be, needed to be

Touch me, o sweet death
Let me forget that I exist
Hold me and catch my breath
Cease me now and hope to resist

Take me for the hour of Venus has come at last
Leave before dawn in order to destroy the past

Yes, let your fire burn and blow life into me
Now is the silence that makes me mortal and free

Touch me, o sweet death
Let me forget that I exist
Hold me and catch my breath
Cease me now and hope to resist

Touch me, o sweet death

All my life, wouldn't feel right
Couldnt explain, feeling insane
When its alright, a call is to fight
Malevolence gets, another backwards regime

And you would sanctify, a murderous game, never again
Collusion breeds disorder, hypocritical fiends constantly

On the boulevard of frozen dreams, life sprung again with unbelievable grace
Whole movements belied by trends, purest motives golden from bliss

And i cant recover all the lust that it gave, like a pool of shame
And youd think we'd have eachothers backs i guess in a fastidious mess

Its a long way home, to the cities ive known, never invested in your promises
Now im lost, with short supplies in, nothin it seems when youve got no regrets

And you would recall all our past mistakes, like they were cigarettes
And you would ignore all the license we took for the saving of face
I feel so messed up in mind, so left out, makes an unhappy one
I do have time, i dont want time
I do care, i dont want to care

Owning mistakes clears plugs from your stream of thought and benefits everyone
A mild case of cold can balloon into a stroke and bath towels soaking in blood

A meth house is not a place of joy, a blanket of nothing isnt warm
And less of you is my idea of fun, with these toy soldiers harassing everyone
We could get along but that'd be dumb, so instead i live in dread of everything 

Lets kick around a funeral drum, and let the kids pick from all that we lost
And do a funny twist, then slit both of our wrists, waiting in disgust for whose at fault

The mexicans, the blacks and all the scum
Everybody else is having too much fun
The separatists, the hindu and the jews
didnt like their look since 1492

An army of the dead is what has come, to torment all our minds til we are one
To Letter leaf, to cheddar, the big bucks
Thank you for breaking into all that i love

Stuck at home and diggin til' im stumped
Thanks to mom for knowin' or id be fuckt
Its coastin from now that im a felon
And hopin' somethins' left of my inheritance 

C F C G C

Sure im Lost, but its better than being dead
I sure do give a fuck and that is my problem

I bet yall think that this is a joke 
Some off-color game you swear that my mind spoke
Ive never been more serious in my life
Better fix your ways or It is judgement time",2,0

Fire from the hatred, bleeding thunder is venom. Your death has come
From the throne of terror, you’ll be flame we’re going to end of destruction
Rising blood, through rising from the darkness sun
Rising shadow through hunt when you left behind
Condolence come with fire
Bring the death standing us in silence
Emptiness comes with the demons
Bringing blood standing us in silence
Emptiness comes with the demons
We are in blast we’re going to the end of destruction
Death’s head enshrined
Take our soul into the void
living in silence of damnation
Through we live not forever
Living in the silence of infliction
Swallows wounds and sorrows
I find a way to find all my sin
Darkness diminished my uneasiness
This destiny becomes eternal restlessness 
I got no time to prostate a servant
We’re drowning in a curse of eternity
We’re drowning in immersed eternity
Dawn, the sun becomes a spirit without end
Moon, lay down rest on blood and wound 
Darkness sun, digging up sadness buried alive in suffering
Darkness world, shaken it loud
Don’t even ask this downfall has come
Unspoken rhymes from the tongue of death
All ask while the angels shout at sinners
Thy rise thy hordes
Resurrected from the dead let the mystical blood a rise
Thy blood thy misery",3,0

ROMPRE LE MALÉFICE 
ROMPRE

De Antonella Eye Porcelluzzi

1.
Je raconte l’histoire
Du bâtard garçon
Qui se marie à une belle fille
Et puis devient cochon
Car il la trompe 
avec un monstre vert

Elle mourra
Il mourra
La bête les tuera

Trop de fois tu t’es caché
Trop de fois tu as mal gagné

C’est le temps
D’embrasser
Le destin ingrat 
Que tu as créé

2.
La foret te branche
La foret te coupe
La tronche

Même pas l’ombre
D’un sourire
Même pas l’ombre

Combien de fois
Tu devras mourir
Avant de
Revenir

Tu n’as pas de guide
Tu n’as pas d’abri

Ton orgueil mourra
Et après ça 
Tu ne seras plus pareil
Un homme nouveau !
C’est promis !


3.
Garçon Bâtard
À la campagne
Il embrasse
Une grenouille
En criant
Qu’elle est 
Sa compagne

Sa passion grouille
Déjà il s’embrouille
l’espadon se souille
Même la grenouille 
Bafouille 


4.
La sorcière doit être
Ta mère
Il n’y a rien à comprendre
Il n’y a rien à défendre
Tu me joues ton bébé 
Et moi
j’ai d’autres choses 
à prétendre

A ton age tu devrais
Me servir le café
Me porter dans les bras
Construire un Hamas
Élever des chevaux
Bien garder le troupeau
Faire renaitre la lune
Et surtout la fortune
Transpirer le parfum !

Mais toi
Toi tu n’es pas malin


5.
Le bâtard rebelle
Le bâtard rebelle
Avec son ami Zizi
Il se croit totalement 
libéré
Il prépare des grigri

Qu’il reçoit direct 
par derrière
Zizi par ci zizi par là
Grigri par ci
Grigri par là

Il ne baisse pas les bras
Il baisse juste son froc
Car il pue le rat mort

Et jouer lui réussit
Mais juste à l’instant
Où il jouit
Le toit lui tombe dessus
Et l’anéantît


6.

Triste è la morte vera
Triste è la morte bianca
L’inferno si spalanca
La mano perde peso
Il sogno è finito 
sotto il tappeto

C’è un ruscello bello
C’è anche un fringuello
La mano di fata
È mia
E nessuno !
Me l’ha mai 
Rubata

Triste est la vraie mort
Triste est la mort blanche
L’enfer est grand ouvert
La main a perdu son poids
Est devient sèche 
comme le désert

Le rêve finit 
sous le tapis

Il y a un joli ruisseau
Il y a un joli pinson
Et la main de fée

Est la mienne !!! 

Et personne
N’a à dire 
qu’on me l’a volée",1,0

A deep and distant ocean
of space, sight & sound
stuck in constant motion
the spiraling down.
Deep into the darkness
where nothing surrounds,
every word dissolving
it’s all breaking down.  

to long for a place
where tears don’t fall
there are no graves
there’s no death
& all we ever need to know, is this our home?
a re-setting of everything after the glow 

brighter than a thousand suns
burning through all that’s been done.
make it new, this is my plea,
mend each and every part of everything
brighter than a thousand suns

coming like a tidal wave, 
tidal wave of change sweeping,  
washing over everything
everything rebuilt, stacking
each and every piece in it's place
finally to be face to face

oh how we long to be
quietly together in peace",1,1

Home sweet Homewood 
Baby baby 
I don’t expect you’ll understand 
It’s cliche but I know this place like the back of my hand 

And I could take the train tracks running behind Aurelios 
All the way back as far as my memory goes...

Well I remember sitting underneath this willow tree on the white logs in the parking lot of Dairy Queen

And when the sun sets at the end of heather road
The signal lights flash reflecting off the glass of my bedroom window 

In sweet Homewood 
Sweet home sweet Homewood...

Catching candy from the curb upon the Fourth of July 
Rollin down willow hill underneath a spinning sky

A short walk up the block holds so many memories 
Quick stop at Pearson’s bakery

In sweet Homewood 
Sweet home sweet Homewood 

Am I moving forward 
Am I moving forward 
Or looking behind?
She took a look at the bulletin board
She found quarter on the floor
When she ducked to picked it up
She faked out the automatic doors

Stepped inside and just to the right she found one of those little machines
Where ya turn the knob left just to see what ya get 
And out popped a little magic ring 

Oh lord wish She would’ve bought a magazine...
Oh lord wish she would’ve bought anything...

Went around to the bakery counter
For some Fresh cinnamon bread
They were fresh out and as it turned out they had some shitty brand instead 

Nice lady said they dont make it anymore 
She got me feeling like a dinosaur 
Oh boy!

And now I’m singing the blues 
I never thought this would happen to me
Oh lord It can’t be! Give me a sign or a clue...
I can tell it was a magic spell 
But I ain’t got proof

She dropped a dime in the check out line coulda sworn she said some magic words
Suddenly a stone like in Indiana Jones started rollin  
But wait it gets worse 

It burst through the wall and we ran down the hall but we were just too slow 
It must’ve rolled downtown cuz here we are now and man it feels like the twilight zone

Where the heck is Sputnik and savoia’s t’go, Off the alley, Tom’s and the rest of ridge road? 

And now I’m singing the blues
I never thought this would happen to me
Oh lord it hit me! am I missing a tooth?
Well I must have missed a trick
Cuz my whole hometowns gone poof!

Oh Revelation revelation at Walts grocery store 
I woke up on the ground to the sound of “clean up on aisle four”

Without any explanation - did I dream the whole thing?
Reached inside my pocket found a little plastic ring
Hush now it’s alright
Hush now it’s alright 
Cardinal and snow 

All is brown and white
All is calm and Bright,
Quiet and cold 

The afternoon 
Feels so new

Silent night holy night 
Silent night holy night 
Steeple and smoke

Hush now it’s alright 
Hush now it’s alright 
Silent and slow

The yellow moon
Passes you 

Smiling on the water
Playing in the haze
High above the quarry 
Trace the silver maze

Of the highway 
Dixie highway...
Halstead street...

As we dream
As we sleep
Well the heart of the south suburbs 
Is in Harvey Harvey the town where I was born
Oh the heart of the south suburbs
Is out in willow springs where the mother zs first performed

I hit the skate shop
Right her on ridge road
I went to the skate shop
seventeen years old 
I went to the skate shop...
Slow slow slow Slow grind
Four wheels crushing gravel 
Rollin over painted white lines

We got the movies and the moon
And the drive thru and the tunes tonight 

Oh let’s go out Orland let’s head to Cal City baby

God bless the sweet concrete between our little towns

Oh baby we got the movies and the moon
Oh baby we got the movies and the moon...
It’s been a while!
It’s been a long long time baby
Since we all got together and just had ourselves a good time 

So let’s go!
Let’s go go Aurelio!
Cuz there ain’t nothin better than lots of mozzarella to bring everyone together tonight  
Don’t need no cheeseburger in paradise

Cuz there ain’t nothin better so here’s my love letter 
Let’s hear it for my hometown slice
Alright!
Swimming underwater at lions pool
I can open up my eyes
Alone with my thoughts for a moment now
As I float and stroke and glide 

The noise of the surface is far away
All I see is feet and legs
Sunlight streaming landing on the ground 
In glowing window shapes 

Chaos at the surface when I emerge
Screaming splashing cannonballs 
I can stand just about anywhere 
Mom says I’m getting tall

But no matter how big and grown up I get 
No matter how important or cool
I don’t think I could ever be too grown up
To swim at lions pool

They closed down the slide 
The sky went gray and green 
The wind and whistles blew
We stood cold and clutching our beach towels 
Around the empty pool

Finally the loudspeaker told us to go home 
And we convinced our dads 
To take us out for pizza at Aurelios 
Do you remember that?

I sometimes wonder what you’re doing now 
I think youre probably something important and cool
I’m writing you this song from underwater now

Ah, the winds of change have swept this nightmare o’er the masses
 How sweet to watch the suffering
How sad to see such waste
Oh, the tides have brought us
Such grand and sundry horrors
From this they flee
For this they grieve

Rise!
Let the forgotten ones return
On this, our day of conquest
The exaltation of the Nephilim

Life-giver, light-bringer
Life-giver, light-bringer
 
Rise!
Let the forgotten ones return
Let the forgotten ones return

Mistress of darkness
Our lady of the swarm
Shining angel of contagion
High priestess in bloodstained robes

A god, a coward, an absentee, a ghost
No more of substance than an offering to the jackals thrown
Empty, feeble, hollow, passive idol

With sight gone blind
The essence of devotion
Infectious paradigm
A faith with reason cast aside

Drawn forth like worms
From the soil as rains turn land to sea
Gorged
Gorged like fleas
Drunk on rancid blood and sick with greed

I’ve seen the stars that bleed across the sky
I’ve seen the dust below
In terror
In terra
In worthless endeavors
From ash to stone
From flesh to seed
How dare we dream 
In such vivid images
When all we've made is broken 
All that we've built is but a facade
The ground that we walk shall wash away

Desperate prayers to callous gods
Whispered under our breath and carried away
Held by stones that care not enough to return them in echo
Weeping sinners every one of us,
We throw ourselves at the feet of idols carved by our own hands
Blessed by another manufactured the same

Now
With nightmare consequences reappearing
The path we've chosen for ourselves can only
End in torment
I laugh
I suffocate
Forsake the noose for a life in chains
Cast out
And disconsolate
Know you now, friend, why the caged bird dies?",7,0

Dentro de tu espejo hay un mundo que está al revés,
en donde todo es negro.
Más, vas acompañada de tu amiga la soledad que vive dentro tuyo

Despoja tus miedos, deja el que dirán atrás,
da por seguro que tendrás delante de tus ojos al cadáver mas vivas que hoy encontraras en este cementerio

No hay mas que hablar, acércate, bailemos
No hay mas que hablar, saca tus pies del suelo
No hay mas que hablar, estoy perdiendo mi credibilidad
toma mi mano y sueña...
Levitar hacia un lugar que esta lejos nuestro
Angel negro

Quiero en  mi cortejo, nada más que una simple flor,
la que hoy tengo en  mis manos
No pienso rendirle cuentas a una generación 
que nunca entenderá  que pasa dentro tuyo
Angel negro
Llórame si quieres, 
no te pediré nena, que me hables si me ves
Hoy ya no me importas tu ,lo nuestro ya quedo atrás

Naufragando en un mar de ilusiones, prisionero de pociones
que momentáneamente están aplacando tu dolor

Hay risas en el cuarto de al lado, 
son fantasmas del pasado que se burlan de ti (...y de mi)
Esperan que te quedes dormida para siempre esperando al príncipe azul

Llórame si puedes, como lo hago siempre
Sal afuera, surca la marea, saca tu cabeza al sol
el viento norte sopla al estribor
Preparadas tus Balas-aladas, mueve tu cabeza al son
siente en las venas todo su fulgor

Hoy es día, mañana tarde será, 
que ironía la vida pesa mas cuan mas vacía esta

Con la plata compraras mas plata, pantomima del campeón
cumpliendo un sueño ajeno a alguien mejor.
Esperan la luz, esperan la cámara y la acción,
agitan banderas, siempre de color

No me digas que no (x2)

Get me off!

Get me off.
I spend way too much time in here.
I want to be in real life,
but it's the state of things.

When you're bored,
and when you have five minutes free,
a total mystery
where this time disappears.

It has me.
It has me.

Verbal brawls
with people that I cannot see.
I never meet them on the outside,
It gets me down.
Why do I bother now?

It has me.
It has me.

I click on articles that make me mad.
Some shared from my friends will make me sad.
Most remind me that my morals are flawed.
I'm in a digital bubble because I am bored.
I could switch it off but I don't.
I could make it stop... 
but I won't.

It has me.
It has me.

Get me off now.

I could switch it off, but I don't.
I could make it stop, but I won't.",1,0

goodbye spaceman, going nowhere
stranded just outside the kuiper belt
he had run out of fuel
he was going so well
might never ever see home again
but his engines they cut out 
so now he's just sitting here singing this stupid song

sun looks so warm
everyone's safer there in her arms
but you ran for a reason that's no place for you
cause nobody wants you there
out here, so cold
life support systems are running low
if the sadness won't kill you i promise you
sooner or later the vacuum will

and away he goes, never seen again
don't you think it's sad, that he left so soon
goodbye spaceman
won't you wish him well
send me away to the colonies in outer space
find me someplace quiet to stay where i can never see another face
cause if i'm treated like an animal long enough 
you know there's a point where i've gotta start acting like one

fun fact for you - they filmed a lot of famous movies here
how's yours doing dear? you got a checklist of required scenes
and you've seemed to fill them out
did you get what you need before we go? 
i never got to discover a body, only stare in disgust at my own
at my own

(the wheel is, the wheel is, the wheel is, the wheel is going nowhere)
even the lonely have someone
they talk through walls in forbidden tongues
you've never seen two so in love
even the lonely have someone
funny how it works out
with evil in the headlights
i'll figure something out, dear
but you don't have to like it
there goes boston corbett
in his gold and black corvette
shooting racists, self-castrating
idol of the 22nd century

weren't you in love with each other
not that long ago
is there a seraphim between you two?
oh, do i wanna know?

the earth is splitting open
hell is on her way out
we're both going to die here
if you don't put the knife down
once we're all in the clear 
you can have venus if you want
i am not the sins of my brothers
i'll find a different rock to haunt

love's all that matters (if it's really what you need)
love's all that matters (is there something we can't see)
love's all that matters (if it's really how you feel)
love's all that matters (will you ever get to heal)
views expressed aren't views reflected
against your shining eyes like silver screen tests
fade off into sleep, sheets graves for honesty
like everything else that you were known to be

your obsessive social media presence shows you partnered with your savior complex
is this why nothing's enough to make you happy?
puzzleboxing headless chickens, codebreakers that never listen
this lifetime is up, i'm tired of dancing

won't you see how far we'll get if everyone just said what they meant
now put your clothes back on, 'cause bashir's james bond

in a sea of red herring emotions we have talked for a million moments
yet one of us has yet to say something 
hostage in a one way mirror, passion garbled, loud and clear
until you leave and i'm stuck talking to myself

but it doesn't matter
but it doesn't matter
[instrumental]
schettino's been demoted, i'm the head of this department now
we take orders to the left and possessions to the right
but we can't turn the ship around
sailing the transatlantic, drowning in the shower
cast your invocation like the witch you are
'cause i wish you could see me now, yeah i wish you could see me now

sinking ships sinking ships sinking ships sinking ships

against the early morning, all i want is self-control
but i wake up with a heartache and my face in the dirt
and the knowledge it's my own fault
in the garden of eden, i'd like to stay awhile
but i'm being used for fluids and spare dopamine
so i think i'll find another style
the clouds are now upon us, the coven can smell my fear
call it operator sickness call it what you will
what i'm looking for was never here

sinking ships sinking ships sinking ships sinking ships

""well dude if you're going to bitch right now the very least you could do is rhyme that shit you'd have something to whine for and maybe girls would even like you more it really is the perfect fit you could make a career out of it but best of all i'm free at night from deciphering your cryptic quips JUST TELL US WHAT YOU MEAN'"" ~ a friend, paraphrased for effect

the mirror shows a young rousseau
his hands are bruised, his heart bestowed
he says that this is not my home
as fingers clasp around my throat
he says to me ""why must you go on?"" (never let them in)
he says to me ""you'll never belong"" (never let them win)
we both know love is not a sin (leave the sinking ship)
you must never let them in

THE FEELINGS STILL DEEP DOWN ARE FAKE DON'T TRY TO HIDE ALL YOUR MISTAKES O, PRETTIEST GIRL EVER MET WE BOTH KNOW THAT YOU'RE LESS THAN THAT I NEVER GOT TO SAY GOODBYE BEFORE I WAS RESCUED BY THE TIDE THE BLOOD OATH STILL STANDS DAYS OF TORMENT WITHIN VEINS THAT WILL STILL BLEED FOR YOU AGAIN
i've been dreaming for the longest time
that i was meant to take the fall
the dust has settled i'm beginning to think
you never loved me at all

won't you let me in?
won't you keep me out?
won't you tell the truth?
were you ever devout?
keep your faith in me
and i'll put my trust in you
let's just face the facts
there's nothing i can do

you're just a parasite
'til death do us part
don't tell me to sing from deepest wound
or to sing from bleeding heart,
sing from bleeding heart

i've been dreaming for the longest time
that i was meant to take the fall
the dust has settled and i'm beginning to think
you never loved me at all

one by one by one
all your flowers wilt
on the road to hell
i will have my fill
feel the way appear
feel myself relax
rid myself of fear
and step forward on my path
and take the plunge

no fear of no fear of no fear of no fear of no fear of no fear of no fear of no fear of no fear of no fear of
too soft to shatter
to weak to prove my worth to you
and do what i must to do
love can't stop me 
from tracking you down 
and taking your light
and snuffing it all out

once my time machine is finished i'm coming for you
the god of time and cute old clueless in your parents' subaru
one of us shouldn't be here, highschool sweethearts fall apart
which one of us must leave
my whole world is spinning, mirrors shifting 
i'm a fragment of who i used to be 

too soft to shatter
to weak to prove my worth to you
eternal servitude
can i wake up now?
i've places to go
and work to do

(and everything is at is was again
we're lying to ourselves again
why am i still here
i know how it all ends
and i can't do anything 
to change it)",10,0

It isn't death cause it isn't life
It isn't a gift cause it isn't a choice
Buddy of bear and misery
There is no door to this field that you dream
Took of that stick from your lips and try to face your fears
There is no jelly field

You're now going to your own world
Now you're losing your own mind

Close to your family that slowly turns you into a zombie
Feelings ? They're all gone
I'll never know how to save you from that jelly field
Alone in his kingdom
The sun has been shining
Over the plastic mountains

Ice has disappeared
Culprits are drowned then
The kingdom is free
We are 15 on the couch but I've never felt so alone
Is it really nine o'clock ?
I should really stay at home

Oh no, I wanna go home, once again
Oh no, party never ends except in my head

I get high and I get drunk
Now I'm tired of all of you
The one I need is my bud and a buck
My girl, a TV, be far from you
Twice of many men are like I am, it's a fact not a chance
I'm pretty sure, in fact, fate isn't exist
If it's not me it's another one

Honey, take caire of it
Did you know how to care ?
Did you know how much luck did you have to live ?
I stay far, tomorrow maybe I will...
I keep smiling while in my head I am sad
I stay here, waiting for something
I stay here to nothing from you

You stay away and I'm still afraid to walk your way

I stay lonely, hidden among my buddies
I keep laughing while in my head I'm crying
I'm still afraid to try something
I'm still afraid to feel something from you
I didn't choose my name
I didn't choose anything
I never knew life was so beautiful around me

I just want to shout
I still don't really realize
That you drag me to my fucking coffin

Maybe tomorrow ? Or maybe today ?
How long have I got ? I'm going it alone

Is it the right time to go ?

An another sip and I'll die
Beer makes happy, drink makes me mad
It drives me crazy then I steal street signs

Beer makes me feel alright, drink makes me laugh
Night makes me stupid then I shred sleeves

And you who are you ?
Today I wish I could smile
I hope did it every morning
But when I wake up I want to shout and then I wanna run away

I cannot be sorry all the time
I cannot be an anvil around your ankle
Fuck the 2000s grey sky
Fuck your globalization
Fuck you misery money
Fuck your shitty society

Fuck your banks
Fuck your bills
Fuck humans
I wanna be dead

I'm the worst punk ever",10,0

啥款的人生才會予人期待  
命運這條線搝咱一路栽  

規路的彎曲你應該會了解
綿爛的日子刺佇阮心內  
 
吞腹內  
固執的心肝  胸坎有山林的硬斗 
吞腹內  
漂泊的運命 胸坎有海洋的大腹 

衝碰的心情毋願閣再忍耐  
成功佮失敗 哪有啥底代  
 
齷齪的心情有你溫柔按耐
沿路的好䆀你我攏理解  
 
你看世界遐爾闊  
欣羨咱的人  誤會咱的人  

你愛咱的無仝款  
特別的心哪  特別的快活 

我佇孤單的時陣想起你  
有你有我才有的風景  
路上有阮種作的花蕊  
我需要你 我需要你  
 
行佇風雨無情的暗暝 
正常人生到底啥意義 
奇妙的心驕傲的自己 
我需要你、我需要你 



What kind of life would make you wanna see what’s down the line?
Fate is the rope jerking us left and right

You should know how the road’s long and winding
Remember the days when we stuck it out fighting

Take it on the chin
Tough as nails, and strong like the mountains
Take it on the chin
A life of wandering, and a heart big as the ocean

No more holding back, my heart races ever faster
Victory or failure, what do they matter?

When I’m down, you’re always there to make things right
You get it, all of it, bliss and plight

Look at this World, far and wide
Some misjudge us, some envy us

You love the ways we’re different
But the happiness we share, totally on the same page

I think of you when I’m lonely
All the beauty that we bring
We’ve planted flowers along the way
You’re the one I need, the one I need

Making my way through this stormy night
What does it mean to have a normal life?
A proud self, and an odd feeling
You’re the one I need, the one I need
我是感覺以後啊 我是等待以後啊
未來是人人向望 這條路正正確確
我是看到以後啊 我是準備以後啊
自由自在睏袂驚 阮欲用心內的歌來咒誓
我是寄望以後的人 我是等待以後會當
只要將心內斟酌看 毋免你約定 毋免你咒誓 
我是寄望以後的人 我是等待以後會當
只要將心內斟酌看 毋免你約定 毋免你咒誓
傳承著你向望 新時代新的人
追隨著你跤步 自由的男兒啊

你掛心一世人 無歇熱無歇寒
為著阮台灣囝 大聲喊彼个名

今仔日咱來相挺啊 明仔載閣有新的人
時代看顧團結的咱哪
今仔日咱來相挺啊 明仔載閣有新的人
時代看顧正義的人哪



I feel it as it’s coming, I’m expecting it down the line
For the future, we all hope  for this road to be as straight as paths go
I see it as it’s coming, I’ve prepared for it to arrive
The freedom to fall soundly asleep, we vow for it with songs in our minds
 
For those after me and you, I long for the day that hopes come true
That no pacts need be made, nor vows taken; tend carefully our hearts and it’ll all come through
For those after me and you, I long for the day that hopes come true
That no pacts need be made, nor vows taken; tend carefully our hearts and it’ll all come through
 
Onward we’d carry the torch from your hand, a new day for the new generation
In your footsteps, we soldier on, as followers, as Free Men
Neither heat nor snow ever held you back. A lifetime’s worry you never rest
For all of us, the children of Taiwan, cry out the name we know best
 
We fight hard for each other today; tomorrow more shall join our way
History favors those that stuck it out together
We fight hard for each other today; tomorrow more shall join our way
History favors those who've got Justice in their corner
敲電話予你 你講今仔日 約佇黃昏時

這个下晡普普通通 閣目一个目聶   按呢就過一日
我的人生已經無著時

敲電話予你 你講無要緊 這條我處理
莫講我匪類 其實我 定定袂記家己佇佗位

過三十以後 有一寡逃避的代誌 佮複雜的心理
花若離枝欲怎樣轉去 

聽引擎振動袂離 咱佇伊身邊
天猶未光 咱出門剾風 精神半醒來流浪

車路邊流目屎的你 變成咱這馬的勇氣
答應我 以後毋管咱欲去佗位

莫為著生活失去自己

自暗時 到早起 現此時 街頂光影流星
自暗時 到早起 現此時 百百人生滋味

我的心 戇戇踅 思念你 恬恬無講話 

我的心思戇戇踅 思念你就恬恬無講話
我的身軀戇戇揣 規工感覺傷心無話 



On the phone, you said we’d meet around sundown
What’s going on? The city’s full of smog
 
This uneventful afternoon, an eye blink away from a wasted day
I’ve missed the mark, and now the ship has sailed away
 
On the phone you told me not to sweat it; you’ll take care of it
Don’t call me useless
Often I forget where I am
Turning thirty comes with things to run away from, and thought and ideas tangle
How do fallen flowers go back on the branch?
 
Sound of the engine in our ears humming; here by his side we’d be staying
Barely daybreak and we’re out cruising, awake and half-asleep in our wandering
From being on the side of the road weeping, you have transformed to being our courage
Promise me, from now on, no matter where we’re heading,
Never lose ourselves trying to make a living
 
From dusk to dawn, now I see, across the streets lights shoot and sweep
From dusk to dawn, now I see, all faces of life, bitter and sweet
 
Round and round my mind drifts aimlessly, missing you keeps me in silence
Round and round my body searches blindly, sadness renders the day wordless
就等你下班  欲來去輕輕鬆鬆彼个夜市
我知影你的工課袂四序  逐工攏予人創治
毋管這現實  今暗歡歡喜喜咱來離開
街仔路倚暗的燈火閃爍爍  咱就做伙來去
做伙來踅一下夜市

排隊  這間莫入去
空位就緊共坐落去  青春有限消遣上要緊 

紲喙的切料攢落去  今仔日換我請你
遊樂有時  因為阮的心已經佮意

踅玲瑯的感覺  鹹酸甜滋味  
攏共當做是音樂來寫  這一切留予今暗


踅夜市的生活  親像咱兩人的青春有時
因為阮的心已經佮意

踅玲瑯的感覺  鹹酸甜滋味
攏共當做是音樂來寫  這一切留予今暗

踅夜市的生活  親像咱兩人的青春有時



Soon as you’re off work, we’re out for a relaxing night at the market
I know work’s always a mess, backstabbing and all
Put aside the day-to-day, the quotidian; the night is ours, we’ll make it pleasant
Street lights dancing with shadows swirling, we’re off to the market, to sei-ya-chi

Not this place, it’s got a line going
Better grab that table, time is a-slipping and the fun’s gotta be happening

Keep the good stuff coming, tonight, I’m buying
Keep the good times rolling, for my heart’s already falling

Round and round, all these feelings, as we roam the market grounds
It’s all music to my ears, let’s make the night count

Through the night market, like the sweet days of our fleeting youth passing
For my heart’s already falling

Round and round, all these feelings, as we roam the market grounds
It’s all music to my ears, let’s make the night count

Through the night market, like the sweet days of our fleeting youth passing
食到這个年歲  時常感覺  生活是虛累累
失去控制  無法度控制

少年時寒人的海邊  熱人的舞台頂  啥物攏新鮮
是咱的過去  無法度過去

毋知欲行去佗位 哎呀呀呀 

趁著這个機會 招你做夥 駛車四界踅踅
就莫想遮濟 講寡幹話

轉來去 寒人的海邊 熱人的舞台頂 佗位攏去過
是咱的過去 青春的意義

時間咧走親像風吹  希望人生海海咱相挺過
我心內的話  對你啊煞講袂出來

日子咧飛無咧相等  希望你我的感情縛足絚
我心內的話  對你啊煞講袂出來啊

看無未來  揣袂著過去啊 



I’ve come to the age where life often feels drab
Got no more control, got no way to control
 
Freezing at the winter beach, sweating on the summer stage, everything was awesome when we were at a younger age
It is now all in the past, it’s something we cannot get past
 
Don’t know where we’re heading. Ay-ya-ya
 
Let me grab this chance, get behind the wheel, we’ll take a ride together
Don’t think too much, we’re just shooting crap
 
Let’s return to that winter beach, to that summer stage, to every place
That’s been in our past and shaped our youthful days with meanings
 
Time flows like how the wind blows. We’ll stick together and weather Life’s storms
Words in my heart I struggle to say when we’re like this, face to face
 
Time flies and it waits for none.  Wishing you and I grow ever closer
Words in my heart I struggle to say when we’re like this, face to face
 
Can’t see the future; can’t find the past
誠心來發願  用腳步擔領  
共心頭掠定  綴祢行

無定的時代 拜請眾神來
為著咱未來 出巡哪

With these words and all my heart, take my part, walk the walk
My mind’s been set and together we march

Though I started this journey alone, fear not, we’re never lonely
With the Sun and the Moon watching over our shoulders

Guide us, heavenly ones,  through this ever-changing whirl
For our sake, please bless us with your Patrol

Holding incense high, though unsure about the future
Have faith, have faith and march on

O, merciful One, I pray
These cracking fire would bring forth your Blessings

Heavenly One, do you hear us? We are shouting with all the voices we’ve got
Heavenly One, do you see us? We are fighting with all our might
Searching high and low, we seek Thee, if only to hear thou sweet singing
Searching high and low, we seek Thee, fear not steep mountains nor deep seas

For the woods under your watch, and the shores under your care
For the generations to come, we’ll stand with you, all of us, right here
For the woods under your watch, and the shores under your care
For the generations to come, we’ll stand with you, all of us, right here
彼一工阿明啊 決心來轉厝
蹛都市七八冬了後
我問伊是怎樣 決心來顧門
共生活就奉獻佇遮 

時間 一直咧流 閣毋轉來袂赴陪伴
等待 相像的人 留落來地方拍拚

出出入入
親戚朋友祝福關心
來來去去
留一葩火有我等你

浮浮沈沈
烏雲海湧已經散去
來來去去
留一扇門有我等你

望時間會留 惜情的戇囝 佇遮看透透
看日子咧走 起落的運命 佇遮看透透

顧佇這 幾落冬
明仔看見新的生活
腳踏實地 歡喜做夢
認真努力 甘願作穡

等待啊 有一工
人人看見咱的遠見
新的機會 舊的所在
有光的路 我等你來



On the day Amin made up his mind to go back home
After seven or eight years in the city
Why’d you become a doorman?, I asked him
Why the life, why here, why the devotion?
 
Time, as tides, waits for none. Go home, be with family before it runs dry
Waiting, for the minds like mine to commit ourselves here back home
 
People come, and people go
Friends and family give their blessings
Back and forth, to and fro
I’ll leave a light on, I’ll be waiting
 
High and low, high and low
The rolling waves and the dark clouds have broken away
Back and forth, to and fro
I’ll be here waiting; I’ll keep a door
 
I hope time stops
Down-to-earth kids, simple, nostalgic
Seeing everything crystal-clear here
Time, it keeps going
All of life’s ups and downs
Everything is crystal-clear here
 
Being right here, all these years
I see a life beyond the new dawn
Feet on the ground, dream with a smile
Honest work for that extra mile

Patiently longing for that day
The world sees us as visionaries
A fresh start in a familiar place
For you on the bright path, I’ll be waiting
我送你去深山林內了後
風雨微微有時月娘偷看
烏雲罩霧 惜別彼工
茫茫前程 陪咱驚惶
守護家園 決心顧佇遮啊
 
失去過去平凡日子了後
重新來過 更加認份過活
山盟海誓 約束傷重  
牽手的伴 當時的夢
美麗島嶼 看咱代代變老
 
佇睏袂去的暗暝 飛去幽暗的山林
毋知終點佇佗位 揣無輕鬆的跤步
誰人咧喝阮的名 若有看著你形影
輕聲細說講袂煞 海是上深天上闊


條直的人行仝款的路 佇烏暗暝走揣啊
指路的星閃閃爍爍 行同齊來堅持啊
精神的人請陪我大聲喊 
平安轉來會有人顧佇遮
你我



Saw you off into the mountains deep
Through the misty drizzle, the Moon sneaks peeks
The day we parted, heavy clouds rolled
Our unsure faces right against the unknown road
Guardians of Homeland, we now firmly stand

Now that ordinary lives are no more
Live this one to the fullest, for here’s a chance to restart
Vows, as heavy as mountains, too heavy to the tongues
To hold hands and grow old, the dreams of days gone

Sleepless nights, into the dim woods we fly 
Trying to find our pace, to push on with no end in sight
Who cries out our names? O, how I long for your frame
The soft touch of words shall never stop, as the oceans deep and the heavens vast

Honest folks all walk the same road, in the darkness they search and they roam 
Stars shimmering guide our way, on the right course we firmly stay
Those awake, lend me your voice, join my roar
Come back, stay safe, someone’s here waiting for you
I am here, and so are you
風 直直吹 吹甲我的目箍紅 
雨 直直落 落甲我的心茫茫

我 思念你 佇世界安靜的時  
我 需要你 佇世界冤家的時

早起的日時 咱相招散步 
行去熟似的彼个所在 
猶未開喙 你就微微呀笑
敢是我的心思你攏知知 

倚暗的時陣 咱沿路轉去
踅來踅去 煞行袂出去
怎樣揣無勇氣 閣牽你的手
我的秘密欲藏去佗位

我 思念你 佇世界安靜的時  
我 需要你 佇世界冤家的時

佇無你的日子 我家己煮食
佇無你的日子 我家己散步
佇無你的日子 我家己爬山
佇無你的日子 我家己踅街
佇無你的日子 我家己看海
佇無你的日子 我家己唱歌

佇無你的日子 我家己散步
佇無你的日子 我家己煮食
佇無你的日子 我家己唱歌
佇無你的日子



On and on the wind blows, so much so it reddened my eyes
On and on the rain falls, so much so it muddled my mind
I miss you
As the world falls silent around me
I need you
As the world wars on clashing
 
In the morning, I asked you out for a walk
A little stroll down our old familiar path
Before anything said, a smile bloomed on your face
Is it because you just see right through me?
 
As the night falls, we head home the same way
Round and round, in a circle with no way out
How come I lost the nerve to take your hand in mine?
Where do I bury this secret of mine?
 
On days without you, I cook by myself
On days without you, I take walks by myself
On days without you, I hike by myself
On days without you, I shop by myself
On days without you, I watch the waves by myself
On days without you, I sing by myself
On days without you, days without you",9,4

A vintage camera, high upon the shelf 
I'll take it down to take a picture of myself 
It's not the kind that I intend to post online 
It's to document my youth, an image stuck in time 

I might be crazy, but I feel myself today 
This picture ain't for you anyway 
Go to the mirror and I give a little sass 
And take a Polaroid picture of my ass 

It looks good in leggings and it looks good in jeans 
Hot in emperor's new clothes if you know what I mean 
A genuine Kodak love letter to myself 
Fifteen minutes to develop, so I'll drink to my health

Ooo! 

I might be crazy but I feel myself today 
This picture ain't for you anyway 
Go to the mirror and I give a lot of sass 
And take a Polaroid of my epic ass

MY ASS 
I'm proud of It
MY ASS 
I'm proud of it 
MY ASS 
I'm proud of it
I'm so proud of it 

MY ASS 
I'm proud of It
MY ASS 
I'm proud of it 
MY ASS 
I'm proud of it
I'm so proud of it 

I don't care if you agree, I asked my mom she still loves me 
One, two, three

MY ASS 
I'm proud of It
MY ASS 
I'm proud of it 
MY ASS 
I'm proud of it
I'm so proud of it 

MY ASS 
I'm proud of It
MY ASS 
I'm proud of it 
MY ASS 
I'm proud of it
I'm so proud of it

MY ASS 
I'm proud of It
MY ASS 
I'm proud of it 
MY ASS 
I'm proud of it
I'm so proud of it 

MY ASS 
I'm proud of It
MY ASS 
I'm proud of it 
MY ASS 
I'm proud of it
I'm so proud of my ass

Behave
Won't sit around all day 
Waiting on your call 
The fact you're ghosting me 
Well that don't bother me at all 

I raise the dead
I kill 'em again just to watch 'em fall 
I'll go out dancing on your grave babe 
'Cause I don't need no one at all 

Go ahead and ice me out 
A frigid corpse that I once knew 
Can't ignore the spirits 
When they're calling out to you 

I raise the dead
I kill 'em again just to watch 'em fall 
I'll go out dancing on your grave babe 
'Cause I don't need no one at all 

My lips are painted red 
Like the door on a church 
Lazarus come out 
My sacred heart about to burst 

I raise the dead
I kill 'em again just to watch 'em fall 
I'll go out dancing on your grave babe 
'Cause I don't need no one at all 

So I won't sit around all day 
Just waiting on your call 
The fact your ghosting me 
Well that don't bother me at all

I raise the dead
I kill 'em again just to watch 'em fall 
I'll go out dancing on your grave babe 
'Cause I don't need no one at all 

I'll go out dancing on your grave baby, baby 
I don't need no one at all
Am I gonna be just another Rhode Island rock star
Do you think I've got what it takes
To break out of the ocean state

If I'm a big fish in a little pond
If I'm a shark, I'm a megalodon 
And I wanna head for open water 

I smell blood in the tide 
And this anchor weighs me down

Not afraid to admit I'm ashamed of my choices 
Of things I've done just to sate my appetite 
If I was wise I'd give up all my vices 
I'd swim toward the sun
I'd be basking in the light 

Then I smell blood in the tide 
And this anchor weighs me down 
Weighs me down 

I know that things will work out fine 
But right now it's hard to tell 

Wasn't looking for anyone to catch me 
You must be a remarkable fisher man 
Spent all my life trying to bite free 
I won't be tangled in a net of lies again 

You know I smell blood in the tide 
And this anchor weighs me down
Weighs me down  

I know that things will work out fine 
but right now it's hard to tell 

So I guess I'm giving up all my plans 
I will go on along with God's instead 
If I'm meant to be bigger than this 
If I'm meant to be a real big fish
You know that I'll be fed 
Yeah, yeah 

I smell blood in the tide
And this anchor weighs me down 
Weighs me down
Lord knows that things will work out fine
But right now it's hard to tell 

It's hard to tell 
It's hard to tell 

Oh man is it hard
To tell",3,2

Kun kuolleen päivän aamu koittaa
Kun musta usva lankeaa
Jo kuiva ilma keuhkot polttaa
Ja elonlanka katkeaa
On saapuva surma soiden
Suuren kirkon sanasta
Kuolema korpimaiden
Rahavaltain valasta

Himoissansa hekumoivat
Verirahain valtiaat
Osingoilleen onanoivat
Kuolon, tuhon kauppiaat

Ja tuhon yöstä ylle kuolleen maan
Musta aurinko nousee kuolemaan

Lohdutonna laulu lintuin
Kadonneena kuusipuu
Ikuisuuteen ikimetsäin
Surulaulu kantautuu
Suuret surmankoneet viiltää
Sydänlihaa äitimaan
Jätöksistään maat jo kiiltää
Verisuonet saasteistaan

Himoissansa hekumoivat
Raiskareiden kuninkaat
Osingoilleen onanoivat
Tuhon tuovat tullessaan

Ja tuhon yöhön yltä kuolleen veen
Mustaan auringonlaskuun
Ikuiseen pimeyteen

Ja alastonna makaa
Vailla suojaa, turvaa lain
Raiskattu emo maan
Eessä aikain lopun
Eessä tuhon tulvien
Nouskaa väet luonnon
Nouskaa väet maan

Himoissansa hekumoivat
Verirahain valtiaat
Osingoilleen onanoivat
Tuonelaan nyt saatetaan

Tuhon yöstä ylle kuolleen maan
Kuolleen maan
Musta aurinko nousee kulkemaan
Nousee kulkemaan
Tuhon jälkeen aika uusi saa
Aika syntyy uudestaan
Taas nousee Päivätär uniltaan
Äitimaa haudastaan
Haudastaan
Tuonelaan, mis raskain taakka
Katoaa, taakse ajan usvain
Tuonelaan, syömmein kaipaa
Tuonelaan
Tuonelaan, mis emoin oottaa
Kantakaa, mun lihain hautaan
Tuonelaan, mis nukkua saan
Ainiaan

Rajat maailmain jo katoo siellä
Mis on vankila lihaisa tiellä
Astu kanssani Tuonen tupaan

Pyhät ovat olennot mailla maanalaisten
Pyhät väet ja voimat alisen

Tuonelaan, jo väkein kaipaa
Hiitolaan, hoviin Hiiden
Tuonelaan, alle vuorten
Tuonelaan
Tuonelaan, käy jo kanssain
Nostakaa, uhrimaljaa
Tuonelaan, pakoon maailmaa
Kuolemaan

Rajat maailmain jo katoo siellä
Mis on vankila lihaisa tiellä
Astu kanssani Tuonen tupaan

Pyhät ovat olennot mailla maanalaisten
Pyhät väet ja voimat alisen

Katso maailmoiden rajaa
Tuonenvirran kuohuntaa
Katso kuinka ikuisuus virtaa

Yli mielen, yli maan
Yli lihan vesi musta virtaa
Eikä vastarantaa nää

Rajat maailmain jo katoo siellä
Mis on vankila lihaisa tiellä
Astu kanssani Tuonen tupaan

Pyhät ovat olennot mailla maanalaisten
Pyhät väet ja voimat alisen
Rytmiin maailman sydämen lyöntien
Liityn kanssanne tanssiin ikuiseen
Kaipuu
Suistaa mieleni raiteiltaan
Kaihoon
Sinne polkuni johtaa saa

Alle kultaisen katoksen
Alle kultaisten lehvien

Missä maailma seisahtuu
Radallaan
Missä oottavi ikuisuus
Kulkijaa
Sinne saapuvi aikanaan
Tuonelaan
Oltta emännän Tuonelan
Kumoomaan

Peittoon
Metsän kuolevain lehtien
Unhoon
Pakoon maailmaa ihmisten

Alle kultaisen katoksen
Alle kultaisten lehvien

Harhaan
Johtaa polut nuo valheiden
Harmaan
Taivaan alla nyt palelen

Etsin polkua tähtien
Takaiseen
Etsin polkua unehen
Ikuiseen

Alle kultaisen katoksen
Alle kultaisten lehvien

Kasvaa jo kuu
Hopeaan pukeutuu

Alinen
Kurkottaa
Ylisen
Tavoittaa

Pakkanen saa
Jääksi muuttaa maan

Alle kultaisen katoksen
Alle kultaisten lehvien

Secret knowledge

These are the words

The secret of the runes

Magic in the light of moon

Singing prayers
To the ancient gods
Invoking powers
Of the mystic arts

These are the words
Of magic domains
The secret of the runes
Hear
The hollow words
The kindling spark
Of tomorrow

See the downfall
The dying stars
Into darkness
The world will fall

In the sea of the sacred lies
In the torrent of the false news
Drowns the reason of man
Lost in the hate and greed
No hope left for the damned
On madness and fear they'll feed

Fear
Drives the masses
The seeds of war
Will bloom

Doomed
Is our world
Is our future
No tomorrow

See the downfall
The dying stars
Into darkness
The world will fall

See the ending
Of our time
Into darkness
Oblivion

We dwell in the night
We dwell in the darkness
Beyond the light

We come into your dreams
It's useless to fight
We bring you nightmares

We are heaven sent
We are heralds of progression
To lay the old world low
Skeptic and unbent
Devoid of meaningless confessions
With wings that made for war
You will not reap what we have sown
 

With civilization at peril, as it's tearing itself apart
Leaving us wondering, wondering how it will come to an end
When ignorance is so viral, treated as if it's some kind of art
Diminish the grandeur by knowing, by knowing it never was grand


Religion is a flaw
And it comes in all shapes and sizes
All man-made gods we scorn
Uphold Sharia law
And witness calamity rising
Because where books are being burned
A lesson is never learned



Scriptures from algorithms
The angels of Atheism


This depth of old deceptions
We will bring to the sword
And thus, when Atlas shrugs
We shall take back this world
I opened the chasm of time
Daring to stare into the past
Relics forsaken that none dare to find
The thawing of truth came to pass

Melting like candles in furnace 
Malformed to a semblance of life
Brotherly hatred in the garden of Eden
The only purity that cuts like a knife

Generations of exile in Europe
Thousands of years without home
Finally given a fraction of hope
Phrasing the end of our tome

Return to the days when Canaan was conquered
Return to Abner’s last words
Rome and Bar Kochva, Greece and the Maccabees
We have always chosen the sword 


Bow to the sword
For it offers salvation
Death is its own reward
And we are the indication

Poisonous stories of sinners and saints
Drawing a picture ideal
The biblical bribery paint ridiculous hate
The chosen people surreal

Be it the anger that thinks we are pure
Be it the land stained with blood
Fighting for lies told eons ago
Legacy of daggers and Scuds 



Every Century passing I could find yet another atrocity


Like the binding of Isaac
And the burning bush call
Like seeking refuge
Behind Messada’s Walls
If Kahane was right
If Baruch Goldstein’s a saint
Then we have long been ignoring
The thin line in the sand

Kill or be killed
Not a single day has passed before you came in tears
Crying rivers of disappointment of how you see things clear
You stand your cracked ground like there’s more things to gain
Forked tongued jealousy smearing soot-black companions’ names
  

Drown in
An ocean of tar
Self-glorification
Will never go far
 

Like a guild house of beggars that piss in the wind
So easy to criticize the achievements of friends
Can’t bask in the glory of your usurper’s mistakes
And if you can’t understand this – it was not yours to take
 

I know it is hard to break through this ceiling of glass
Some passions are burning and some hungers are too aching to pass
When invisible wounds heal they still leave these scars
Don’t let your dignity drown in an ocean of tar
You’ll make an excellent example
Of how history was written 
Victories and burning temples - rise
To this venomous occasion

A narrative no one wants to hear
The ink has that has dried drove us to gloat
And as this mosaic of falsehood begins to tear
We’re holding knives at each other’s throats

Our destiny’s declined
Remove every thought of shelter
We chose to undermine
All that we built around the center


At each other’s throats with blades at hand
At each other’s mercy foolishly we make our stand

Embarrassment to every nation
The child that just refuses to grow
The cradle of civilization - falls
Allows us both to sink so low

A narrative no one wants to hear
An old composition - all from bleeding notes
Like the roman soldier that held the spear
We’re holding knives at each other’s throats

Our Destiny’s Declined
Remove every thought of shelter
We chose to undermine
The gates collapsed - all demons, enter


Blood was thick and now the sons of Abraham
Diluted it to the extreme and the worst is yet to come
Circling around the fire - since the dawn of time
Oh how we deserve each other - dear enemy of mine
בשני זוזים של כסף ובשלשלאות ברזל
הובילני אל פתחי מקדשו של זה האל
אשר שיסה עמו בדופי, בחירוף ולהבות
וקיבץ אדם מתוך פזורה אל תוך כבשן הגלויות
 
לא נותרתי איש-עולם ונלקחה הנחמה
כאשר דודיי נפלו הם ארצה, מקדשים האדמה
וכל אביון דורש צביון ומחטיף מהלומה
על חומותיך עיר דוד אתקין לך מרגמה
 

כי משנאת אחים נבראתי
משאון המרכבות
מהרעל שבמים
ומאש המלחמות
 

עם בוא אחיי נולד הדור אשר מאס ברפש
מילא הביב את זה הים, עלו מימיו עד נפש
אך בני כלאיים, בני אלפיים, מה להם ולעולם
כל שנועדנו זה לדעת שהגורל חותם בדם
 
אם לנצח נאכל חרב אז לנצח נתחתן
עם כלה שחורה כפיח, ועם תן רעב רוטן
אדם קטן כמוך, יבלע בבטן לוויתן
השם ישבור הסטטוס קוו וישליכהו לכבשן
 

מניף את הפטיש למעלה, וחובט אל הסדן
אותו נפח בצלם אל, משחיז עמו אל תוך כבשן
אך לא נצא מסדנתו אלא בארונות קבורה
כך הובטחת לנו, ארץ זבת מרה שחורה

אשרי כרעיה של הארץ
אשרי גפרור מסך עשן
מושך אני את השרשרת
ואת כולכם, אל תוך כבשן
In the days of Turnusrufus
Before ten martyrs gave their lives
Four stepped on stairs of studies
But only one survived

The legend of true paradise
Amongst the halls of God
Where marble breaks your words like water
Where we realize we’re flawed


Under Roman persecutions
Beneath the Praetor's boot
Four wish to strive tofind the answer
Where divinity takes root

Verse 2: Upon the chariot of fire
That no one dares to ride
Creation and oblivion both beckon
Beneath a white winged bride




Hidden congregation
Disappears into the night
They will reach the pinnacle
Salvation’s only light
Seven days of holy fervor
Yavne’s wisdoms scorned
The four will reach the pinnacle
Tiferet - ancient throne

Verse 3: They’ve fast and drank no water
So worthy they will be
The four enter the gates of heaven
The pinnacle calling thee
White marble halls of heaven
A garden locked in time
Tiferet - ancient throne
Soon you will be mine
I was born a shepherd’s boy
A poor and ignorant man
For love I studied and enriched
For love I’m doing what I can


Aleph of our one true father
Taf for all that ends
Eschaton, oblivion
Now I understand

 I knew why my love was taken for granted
I know why I am here
I will know all my mind could study
The rest will disappear
Earthly riches seemed diminished
Even before I took this oath
Enemy of Rome I am
Edge of the undergrowth


The flock of angels pushes me
To stray from my path
The pinnacle of holy marble
The choir of the aftermath
And as I enter all alone
Bare witness to true might
White bride - her face true beauty
Enriches me with light
I tried to grab Akiva’s garment before he took that step
We entered four, four different gates, and then Akiva left
They told me I am fire, they spoke in different tongues
But now I see the truth that’s hidden ‘neath the face of Metatron


Akiva! betrayer, he left us for dead
We entered the garden succumbed to our dread
The angels, the faceless, the arms of Tiferet
Now your false form has been shed


I must warn the others
From Jerusalem to Rome
There is no salvation hidden
On the steps of an ancient throne
We were born to be devoured by
The mouth of Metatron 

 Young Ben-Azai claimed he would stand on guard
Before he vanished, taken by forces we could barely describe
Then Ben-Zuma snapped, his mind was crushed in despair
The thought of our souls being fed to the bride was too much to bare


I’ve taken my broken and babbling partner
I’ve run down the spiral of white
“Akiva is mad, Akiva betrayed us”
Ben-Zuma is shouting in fright

Ben-Azai is nowhere to be found
He has shed his body like cloth
Only Akiva still lingers
Only Akiva has forsaken his oath
Orchard of pomegranates
The fruits are made of cyphers
A secret hidden deep 
I’ve seen it all still none the wiser

Akiva stands before me
His heart and mind malformed
“Follow me or be like the others”
He said I have been warned


I would not stand against her
The bride’s distorted form
Her face, a swarm of tentacles
She is divine, we are but worms
But if this is divinity
If this is what fate concealed
I’d rather tear down every tree
Than give my soul and yield

Verse 2: Akiva’s eyes are like stones
Gray as the clouds of the night
He knows the answer, he whispered
Given to him by the monster in white

He will gather the faithful
And declare a war against Rome
He will find and anoint his Messiah
And all will die in this storm



C-part:
I tried to get Ben-Zuma to safety
Fooling Akiva that I’ve joined his cause
“Akiva is mad” babbled my friend
“And our death will be his applause”
We barely reached the town of Yavne
And I left him on the porch of a whore
“Aren’t you Ben-Abuya the wise?”
She asked, letting her words explore

“You are mistaken, Madam” I answered
And I gave her two silvers and left
“Must’ve been some other” I heard her voice carry
Hoping it is not too late



As I come to the garden of Yavne
Surrounded by Akiva’s lies

Toiling and tearing the roots of the garden
As I wait for the Sabbath to die

“Blasphemy!” carried the voice of the people
Stricken I now realize


The Bride of white will not take hold
In this world or the next
For the next world is a mere illusion
And this one is here to vex
This is the God who waits in heaven
This is the bible’s lie

BLACK DOG

Born with an invisible twin
As I grew, he grew within
Hidden away in my early years 
Feeding off of my deepest fears 

Adulthood I reached 
He reared his head 
For no good reason 
My happiness dead

Fear the Black Dog 
Fear his craft 
Fear the Black Dog 
Fear darkness inside of me

Head bowed down low
I trudge the streets aimlessly
Trying to find a way out
Of this infernal hell

Fear the Black Dog 
Fear his craft 
Fear the Black Dog 
Fear darkness inside of me
PERSONALITY TORN

I just want to be myself
I just want to be myself 

In an age of online life 
And a need for approval 
People advertise their lives
To an indifferent world

Pretend friends 
Never there when in need
If the trends are not followed
De-friended is the deed

In Search of Meaning 
A Personality Torn
A Public demeaning 
A Personality Torn

In desperation
Reaching out to far
Silent backs are turned 
Time to end this hell

In Search of Meaning 
A Personality Torn
Public demeaning 
A Personality Torn

I just wanted to be myself
I just wanted to be myself 
A Final post......death of a lonely friend....
KING OF SPITE

My hard efforts 
Spat on
My life's work
Kicked to one side

Zest for Life
Denounced
Void of Passion
Dying inside 

Endure the Brutal truth
Suppressive Life, so hard to take
My last breath, the glorious fight 
Damnation,  King of Spite

Down and out
Cursed
Suicidal
End this life

Live or die
Decisions
Time to fight 
Annihilate

Endure the Brutal truth
Suppressive Life, so hard to take
My last breath, the glorious fight 
Damnation,  King of Spite

Life-style
Death-style 
Manifest Destiny
Taking it all down

Damnation, King of Spite
Damnation
Damnation
Damnation
Damnation
Damnation
Damn it all to HELL
MURDERERS

A scapegoat required 
Political hate
Taking of power 
Liberty lost,  too late

Into the ghettos
Herded in
Fearing the gun
Stripped of your humanity

The crooked cross leads to pain 
Memories of murder, a mental stain
The agony of staying alive
Stare in their eyes as you die

Policy now decreed
Extinction process
Vermin in their eyes
Die for your creed

Join the endless line
Stripped down
Into the showers,  soap in hand
Generations Destroyed

The crooked cross leads to pain 
Memories of murder, a mental stain
The agony of staying alive
Stare in their eyes as you die
VIRUS

Warnings all through history
Heeded not, blinded by life
A dark wind blowing in the east 
A pestilence spread by greed

Locked down 
Too late
Millions die
Sickened fate

Don't take away our liberty
Hampered not, economy first
Money talks, the virus walks
A demon among us,  stalking 

Locked down 
Too late
Millions die 
Sickened State

Good news travels too fast 
Open your doors,  deadly embrace
2nd Wave, the virus mutates 
The end of mankind
The end of mankind
The end of mankind
SEASON OF THE WITCH

A soul long sold
Calculating and cold
Seeking out new born children 
To empower as foretold

The villagers are restless
An evil lies within
Crops are failing, cattle dying
The Children fall to sin

Burn Witch Burn
We cast thee out
Cursed Black Goat
Sever the Head,  and cut out the heart
The Witch-finder will end
The Season of the Witch
The Season of the Witch

Fingers pointed, suspicion high
Seek her out,  the Witch must die 
Down to the lake, the ducking stool
Will she drown or burn?

Tied to the stake, she curses
Your children's children damned
Her dying words, non-repentant 
Body twitching, blood boiling

Burn Witch Burn
We cast thee out
Cursed Black Goat
Sever the Head,  and cut out the heart
The Witch-finder will end
The Season of the Witch
The Season of the Witch
THE CHAIN  

Listen to the wind blow
Watch the sun rise
Running in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies

And if, you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)

Listen to the wind blow
Down comes the night
Running in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies

Break the silence
Damn the dark, damn the light
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
WELL OF SOULS

Down and down I fall
Tumbling into the black
Descending into Darkness 
Falling without end

Looking around as I fall
I am not alone 
Many souls share my path
Together, bound, head down

Following my heart
Trying to achieve my goals
Destiny so cruel 
Down the Well of Souls
Where it ends no one knows 
Down the Well of Souls 

Many of us try
And many of us fail 
Desperate for happiness 
Life is not a fairy-tale 

Fated not to love
Dragged on down to hate 
Arms outstretched I fall 
Now it is too late

Following my heart
I try to achieve my goals
Destiny so cruel 
Down the Well of Souls
Where it ends no one knows 
Down the Well of Souls
DAGON

Forever watching 
Down in the depths
Waiting for the time to awake
Waiting to seal our fate

Written in runes to see
An ancient warning
He'll spread his seed across the earth 
And baptise his children in human blood

Ancient power rising 
Dagon Lord of the Sea
Ancient hatred of mankind
Dagon Lord of the depths 

Is there hope for gods children?
Will the earth be saved?
Shall the sea tyrant return?
And create the world he craves?

Ancient power rising 
Dagon Lord of the Sea
Ancient hatred of mankind
Dagon Lord of the depths

No stone was dropped into the water,
No breeze whispered in the ears of the cloves,
No bliss sat beneath the pillow, you are no more

You were war,
The union of subtleties
You were war,
The occurrence of calamities

You,
The bitter humor of our rat race
You,
The sorrow of aught and naught

You were peace,
The wind in your hair
You were patience,
The eyes,
You were home,
Pleasant, lonesome,
You are no more

You were flame,
The light amongst the dark
You were flame,
The breath amongst the smoke

I,
The ever burning ember,
I,
The moth to your flame,

You were war, You were peace,
You were patience, You were home,
You are no more
I submit, I burn
I kneel, Before your hate 

I serve, your fire 
I burn, for your desire 
I pray in your name
I succumb, to your might

Make me the vessel for your contempt 
Pour into me your flame
Consume my flesh as your fuel
Crush my bones as your coal

Send me your hate, 
I give you my love, 
As I am your ash,
For your ember 

As I slit your throat,
And look into your eyes, 
As your blood washes my hands, 
And I burn with your love 

In murder I’ll melt 
I’ll melt in your abyss 
I’ll be one with you in violence 
My love dissolves into your hate 

Our final reunion of blood and flesh 
My final act of love and hate
Now we are forever together 
Beneath this charred soil.

As life leaves your body
As I feel your cold skin
As the light leaves your eyes 
As I dance with your lifeless body 
As the heat of the fire clashes with the cold of your flesh 
As my love reaches it’s closure 
As our bodies and soul dissolve 
As I burn with you in my embrace 
As your hate becomes the fuel to my love
As my love becomes the melody to our dance
As we turn into burning embers
As the flame finally goes out 
We are eternal now...",3,2

We passed the fields of gazing grain We passed the setting sun 
As the beat of the drums calls for my life I lean my head to the ground 
There is no inn on the path to the sound So where shall I sleep tonight?
I walk to the place where the blue shadows creep and winds of the desert weep 
You think that you’re in control That you can cheat death that you’re in control 
The time we get here is a blink of an eye Just a tear drop in the Atlantic sea 
A billion dots in the universe A split second in history 
And the coming of death is a fearful blow The cold and the moony smile 
The secret things of the grave are lost 
The black mother doesn’t care about you 

We’re here just for a little while Before we’re all dirt in the ground 
So let’s try to make the best of it Let’s make the most of it 
We’re all the same, when where down in the ground 
We’re all the same, when we morph into soil 
Do you really want to throw the first stones? 
And be remembered for when you are gone 
Now we’ve given up the ghost, now it’s time to bite the dust 
And if you come to my funeral, don't bring a thing 
Just sit back and listen, to when the fat lady sings…",2,>1000

COOL DOWN 

My my lonely mind
runs against the bloody knives
still awaiting changing times

""Afterlife"", plays in fade
floating brain on discotheque
rattlesnake shakes the tail

Think I could, think I should
my holy waiting still too long
I want it all, in one ""mad dog""

Don’t think to forget 
what we did, what we had
expectations never rest

You, always can surprise me 
every time, jumping on my soul ""yin""
making mess, boiling blood inside me
you’re my light, or the only choice I have

You, always can surprise me 
every time, jumping on my soul ""yin""
making mess, boiling blood inside me
you’re my light, or the only choice I have
Please COOL DOWN
FALLING LEAF
 
Please don’t touch me with your light, I’m in the dark
I'm just a victim of your fears, keep in mind
I want a cheap sadness, dear, I have the right!
You are bleeding as a fat leech, you’re too bored
I want.......to fade away

Come to me as lion, you’re my cat
Cry alone don’t make sense, sleep away
More masks than the people, you will meet
When nothing goes right... go to left
I need to feel as a falling leaf 

Come on, if you dig into my wave, you will find the ocean, is too deep for you
and You know, you try to destroy the silver palace, cause it’s a source of shame for
you and for us, and you've bet us all, all this for nothing, but I remember, cause it’s
all my mind

Shake my liver for a new taste, nothing more
Life’s too short to worry.... too long to wait
Don’t get lost behind, the lost things
Words are not enough, I need sound and paint
I need ..... to feel as a falling leaf I need ..... to feel as a falling leaf I need ..... to feel as a falling leaf
I need ..... to fall in love
MENTAL COMPENSATION
 
Not convinced, life will never change
It’s the same
 
Never mind, if the pressure’s too high
Sacrifice
 
When I think that my guardian angel, 
always drinks
 
Now it’s time to run away together
Only a ray of sun will light our way
 
Ivan said, what If my whole life 
has been wrong?
 
Bernay said, that we are sleeping puppets
bloody right
 
Now it’s time to run away together
Only a ray of sun will light our way
Now it’s time to fly away forever!
Discover love and make it known to the world
FEEL ME AGAIN

You came here, always late
Come on try to forget the time passed away
Feel my body warm as you are
Squeeze the love …kiss my lips!

Love is a carpet shook today
Look the sun floating on sea
Remember times, remember smiles
Call me white flower again

Can you feel me again?
close your eyes and smiling
Kiss me
Can you feel me again?
close your eyes and breathing
Kiss me

Leave me alone watching the wall
Hang my soul, hang it on you
Ride waves, hide smiles
You are mine and I’m in love
Dear wind, bring me with you
I feel the smell of love on you
Love the life, love the mind
Sure I love you sure real feel
TRUE EYES

I don’t care if you are right
You can say what’s on your mind 
 
Shadow falls behind my sun
I think today I can survive
 
Looking into the true eyes
Just now, all the senses are flying high
You are all for me 
 
I don’t think that you are crying 
I can say a a alright   
You can tell me you’re the one
Mother, help me to remind

Looking into the true eyes
Just now, all the senses are flying high
You are all for me
SENZA PIETÀ


Parli e non mi guardi se in simbiosi con 
la mia mente
Hai una voce stridula, 
che mi urla ripetutamente

Conosci il silenzio,
lo rompi volutamente
Vulnerabile..
..e cadi giù con un sorriso facilmente

Spesso ti nascondi nella quotidianità
Ma riappari all’improvviso, senza pietà

Ho bisogno di parlare col silenzio che da tempo non fai passare
Chiedo solo, solo, umiltà....., senza pietà….
Notte porpora

Notte, dolce pensare
Sfiora il tuo candore
Vero, sai sognare
Senza alcuno stupore

Viene, lei sa da dove
Oltre la dimensione 
Fredda, senza scuse
Strappa ogni emozione

Ohh puoi parlarmi? vuoi parlarmi!?!...
Ohh puoi parlarmi? vuoi parlarmi!?!...

Vertical and put that cap up on my bra-ain bra-ain
Oh I swear it could be like this every da-ay da-ay
Can I feel it how I feel it if I ma-ay ma-ay?

I was riding with nothing on but my Birkiee e-ees
Late night, strategizing out the thirtyy y-yy
Comes in wuh-uhns and twos
Even three-ee ee-ees
Caught some UV on my tongue and it was swee-eet swee-eet
Tell em swee-eet swee-eet like swee-eet swee-eet like

(Keep track of time, control your mind)
(Keep on the line, unfold your eyes)
(It's yours and mine)
From my phone to your bones, feel the wa-a-ave
(It soars so high)
Through your eyes, up your nose, feel the wa-a-ave

With your heart and your soul, feel the wa-a-ave

Yeah

Ayy, yeah
Sensei, sensei

[Chorus]
Ayy, think I got a hunch
Send my boys to the store, told 'em grab a bunch
D-Floor, 2 PM, we were having lunch
Say you’re writing hits, but I only heard it once

[Verse 1]
Yeah, keep on seeing more blue ticks in my DM’s
Got my hometown walking 'round like a museum
I could fit in any category they put me in
You can ask me if I look European (Okay)
That means my singles drop on C.E.S.T
These whips aren’t foreign, they don’t impress me
Ass looking like Dizzy Gillespie mid solo
Only brush my teeth for the album promo
And you can catch me on a flight delayed to FCO (Uh)
Say you don’t bite until you met me though
Three-pointer, lines off the net, free-throw
Life on the line, both sides, threes and zeros
And why be a snack? You could be a three-course meal
I take girlfriend out to the rave, I keep the stash in the heel
I went Footscray just for a fade and back on stage for the show
I spend half my life on layovers got no hurry to grow

[Chorus]
Oi, think I got a hunch
Send my boys to the store, told 'em grab a bunch
D-Floor, 2 PM, we were having lunch
Say you’re writing hits, but I only heard it once
Ayy, think I got a hunch
Checkpoint, twenty grams, sewed into the scrunch
Yeah, when I sat down, swear I heard a crunch
Ocular pat down, I avoid a punch

(This my favorite song, why’d it, why’d it take so long?)
(This my favorite song, why’d it, why’d it take so long?)
(This my favorite song, why’d it, why’d it take so long?)
Yeah, sensei, sensei
Oi, so

[Verse 2]
I can see it clearly, no really
Running laps around the club just like I’m wearing Heelys
You can ask my Siri when I push, I got no weapon concealy
Servicing, I could stream all of ""One Piece"" just straight off my 3G
I’m on my ones, the crew you seeing in my vids are just C.G
I put on for my species, only rapping for freebies
Merely you see, my hands are tied, I got a cosign to pester
When I get that Vespa, the first thing that I be doing’s a wheelie

[Verse 3]
Acting silly I could see that you be uncertain
Like my passport, wait, I got two versions
On my last raught, ayy, I copped two slaps, wait
Yeah, I loose track, wait, red and blue curtains
Rendezvous, Ferdydurke, after I be working
In the park by the gate, see a body lurking
Hunchback posture, on the ground searching
Raised right, Romanite, write this shit in cursive, uh
If you could decide, uh, what kind of life, yeah
I’m a rider, real North sider
If you could decide, uh, what kind of life, yeah
I’m a rider, North North sider

Send my boys to the store, told 'em grab a bunch

Checkpoint, twenty grams, sewed into the scrunch
Yeah, when I sat down, swear I heard a crunch
Ocular pat down, I avoid a punch
Oi, think I got a hunch (Yeah)
Send my boys to the store, told 'em grab a bunch

[PART 1]

(Verse 1: DoloRRes)

I am a citizen, you are the heat
I see the back of my head from across the street
The alarm's going off, go to camera 3
And if you say you could be anywhere then where would you be?

Cos talking is stranger, explain what you mean
Talking is dangerous so why ever speak
Ask for an address, buzz in my jeans
Standing in circles, trying to leave
So we can..

(Chorus: DoloRRes & Gus)

Go, Do you wanna go home?
Do you think that we should leave it alone?
Go, Do you wanna go home?
Do you think that we should leave it alone?
Go, Do you wanna go home?
Do you think that we should leave it alone?
Go, Do you wanna go home?
Do you think that we should leave it alone?

(Verse 2: DoloRRes)

I’m getting tired of this suit, can you help me unzip it
And peel out the tires, if there’s a happ I don’t wanna miss it
If you could show me how to turn an hour into a minute
Everybody has a side, everybody a witness
You were here from the jump, (hey!)
I’m just flicking through channels
Take a look at your hands (Hey!)
You’re a cell, you’re an animal
(Underneath!) any option it could always be wrong
And it stays when I leave and it’s moving along so we can

(Chorus: DoloRRes & Gus)

Go, Do you wanna go Home?
Do you think that we should leave it alone?
Go, Do you wanna go Home?
Do you think that we should leave it alone?
Go, Do you wanna go Home?
Do you think that we should leave it alone?
Go, Do you wanna go Home?
Do you think that we should leave it alone?

[PART 2]

(Verse 3: DoloRRes & Gus)

It's all happening somewhere else
It's all happening somewhere else
Why be here when you could be somewhere else?
Why be you when you could be someone else?
The big hand turns, moving in time
The big hand points and carries the light
And if you do twice as much then you'll double your life
And if you live long enough you can't technically die

(Another Chorus: DoloRRes & Gus)

Subdivide, Subdivide, Subdivide
Spinning, Spinning around on the inside
Subdivide, Subdivide, Subdivide
Spinning, Spinning around on the inside
Subdivide (hold tight I’m coming to get ya!)
Subdivide (hold tight I’m coming to get ya!)
Subdivide (hold tight I’m coming to get ya!)

In the open fields, find it hard to tell what's real

Had to use my hands cos the grams was way too sticky
Catch a couple hands, bad lands it get risky
Lurkin through the thirty, watch my six and I watch my sixty

Never caught a case, I'm still ducking from the police

She can't keep to herself now she got her hands on me
Swear I never seen you in my life, where you know me from?

And more or less, if it’s all a test, it came on so suddenly
(Yeah, it’s me and you, I promise)
These people in your life, deceitful with their lies, Were you expecting more?

I’ll always empathize, and even when I say my goodbyes
It was never a thing for me

And I’ll let you be

There's too many snitches, in my way

Too many real ones, too many friends
I need a hater, I need enemies

Everywhere I look-
Things are getting worse.
People full of anger
And everything seems cursed.
Sewage in the rivers
Smog up in the sky.
Endless brutal violence
Does anyone know why?

Chorus: The world is my ashtray (x2)
And there’s smoke in my eyes!

Everywhere I look
Things are getting bad.
Who should I blame?
Perhaps your mom and dad?
Repugnant evangelism-
Jesus up for sale.
And then there’s captain Ahab-
Hunting the great white whale.

Chorus: The world is my ashtray (x2)
And there’s smoke in my eyes!


Love can conquer all
In this I still believe.
Though I have been blinded
And my heart has been deceived. 
People full of sorrow-
The sorrows never cease.
Where the hell is Justice-
And that road that leads to peace?

Chorus: The world is our ashtray (x2)
And there’s smoke in our eyes!
Don’t fit in--at the end or beginning.
Or in between--breathings not living.
It’s all too much, don’t touch me.
I’m a little rough, touch me. Ahhhh!

Always on the move—I travel like a drifter.
And I can read your mind—I’m a human transistor. 
Ahhhh!

Can you help me solve--this painful puzzle?
I’m losing my resolve—my brain is a muddle.
It’s all too much—don’t touch me.
I’m a little rough—touch me. Ahhhh!


Can’t relate—to all these people.
Am I just a mistake? Is my condition lethal?
They call it a gift—or even a talent.
But I call it curse—which is equally valid.
It’s all too much, don’t touch me.
I’m a little rough, touch me. Ahhhh!
Where are you going to? What will you be?
How will you get there? And what will ya see?
Wrap your arms ‘round yourself-Shudder inside.
So much to give and so little time
You pray!

Roads stretch before you- Which one do ya take?
you bit in the apple and ya threw it away.
Walking in the shadows-Ghosts mesmerize.
Body on fire-to reach paradise
You pray!

Destinations.

Nomads and vagabonds, they speak in your ear.
They offer you riches…you wrestle with fear.
You try to hold onto what daddy said…
Waging a battle with yer heart and yer head
You pray!

Destinations.

Where is your refuge? The sweet church of peace?
Who is that angel? Where is the beast?
You're feeling his breath and it’s hot on yer back.
You turn ‘round to face him and you stare at yer past
And pray!

You’ll find your road someday and make it yer home.
In a palace of people, you say: “I’m still alone.”
But You’ll keep on walking to find what ya need.
And when storm clouds keep comin, you fall on your knees
And pray!

Destinations.
Well you don't want me.
But baby, I want you.
I need your lovin'-baby
I want your stew!
They call me the catman-
I'm on the prowl.
Outside your window-
You hear me meoooowwww!

Chorus:
Catman baby!-nine lives aren't enough.
Scratch my butt-scratch my butt-
and watch me strut my stuff.

What's happening black?
Catman's in town!
I cough up a hairball-
I see you frown. 
I'm just too damn funky.
You can't even compete.
Even if I fall-yeah, you know:
I still land on my feet. 

Well, this ain't no story.
This here's the truth!
You see me freaking--
""Who dat up on the roof?""
Well I chase the mice. 
You know I eat 'em raw.
Hey wait a minute-this ain't no hand.
This here-is my claw-paw!
v1

If ""hope is the thing with feathers""
Like the Myth of Amherst said-
Then come down from your 2nd story-
Recite your poems to me instead!
 
Chorus:
Change your white dress for a red one-
Don’t shun my company.
It may be snowing in New England-
But here’s a rose for Emily.
 
v2

If ""recollecting were forgetting""-
Then I don’t recall a thing. 
Desire becomes our maddest joy-
Like the bumble bee in spring.
 
Chorus:
Change your white dress for a red one-
Don’t shun my company.
It may be snowing in New England-
But here’s a rose for Emily.
 

v3 

Your ""life closed twice before its close""-
And how that happened no one knows.
When death stopped by, hurling curses-
You charmed him with your dazzling verses!
 
Chorus:
Change your white dress for a red one-
Don’t shun my company.
It may be snowing in New England-
But here’s a rose for Emily.

v4

So here’s to the Myth of Amherst-
In seclusion of her mind.
""From blank to blank a threadless way-
‘Twas lighter to be blind"".
 
Final Chorus:
Change your white dress for a red one-
Don’t shun my company.
It may be snowing in New England-
But here’s a rose for Emily.
Well the rose turned black-
the petals are bruised.
The bush was burned back-
and the blossoms abused.
The thorns are still sharp-
but the ground is parched.
So we packed up the tarp-
and we started to march.

We don't know where we're going-
just call us refugees.
Mama does the sewing-
but we all have our duties.
There's a barricade in front of us-
a civil war behind.
A wall is just superfluous
when your life is on the line.

No I didn't cross the border-
the border crossed me first. 
You're screaming law and order-
as if I'm not coerced.
A threshold is a threshold-
and a map is just a map.
Please accept this marigold
as I trip your booby trap.

Well, a man does things from hunger-
he'd never do for fun.
I have no plans for plunder-
and neither does my son.
So call me what you want-
a ""bad hombre"", a ""bandito."" 
But a bet a million pesos
You'll eat my damn burrito.
The Land of Babaloo
V1
There is a place where we should go
I want you to come too.
So take my hand and I will show
You the land of Babaloo.
You cannot find it on a map
Nor on the Internet.
To get there you must take a nap
And remember what you’ll forget. 

Chorus:
O I love to read a story.
O I love to hear a poem.
I’ve travelled a hundred million miles
And never left my home.
Where is this land of eternal bread? 
It’s around the corner, just there…
Just up ahead.

V2
Grownups can seldom find their way
For they have too many worries.
Like jobs and time and bills to pay
And hurry, hurry, hurry!
But in the land of Babaloo
The last are first and dreams comes true.
There’s no more hunger, no more thirst.
You’re like a balloon that will never burst.

Chorus

V3
Some children like computers
And there’s nothing wrong with that.
But me I like the smell of books
Whether skinny, thick or fat.
Life isn’t always easy.
At times it can be tragic.
But read a book and you’ll be hooked.
Books are gosh darn magic. 

Chorus
I'd never say, so you wouldn't know.
I watch you from behind my shadow.
I'd never tell what my eyes conceal-
your heart of hearts I'd like to peel.

Chorus: 

And I'd like to wake up
from this dream and I 
need your touch like I need caffeine. 
But it seems my tongue has atrophied-
I'm a leper of love hiding in the trees.

I try to speak, it doesn't come out right.
It seems my eyes aren't used to light.
I want to harvest flesh instead of my mind-
I'm falling apart, so please be kind!

Chorus:

And I'd like to wake up
from this dream and I 
need your touch like I need caffeine. 
But it seems my tongue has atrophied-
I'm a leper of love hiding in the trees.

I try to dance, but my feet are numb.
I trip and fall and come undone.
I'd never tell what my eyes conceal-
my heart of hearts it wants to feel!

Chorus:

And I'd like to wake up
from this dream and I 
need your touch like I need caffeine. 
But it seems my tongue has atrophied-
I'm a leper of love hiding in the trees.
Hello people, have no doubt
I got something to say.
I was not a good boy scout
I had the need to disobey.
And in the woods of solitude
I had a one-man revival.
With visions of beatitude
And life beyond survival.

Chorus:
I said go, go, go—be more like Thoreau.
Go, go, go—Henry David Thoreau!
Like Vincent Van Goh doing Tae Kwon Do
I won’t be the puppet in your puppet show!

I want to live deliberately
And taste the marrow of life.
Renouncing white supremacy
“That’s damn good advice!”
For privilege is as privilege does
It depends on how you use it.
We all got skin in this fight we’re in
So let’s bring on the music.

Chorus:
Let’s go, go, go—be more like Thoreau.
Go, go, go—Henry David Thoreau!
Like Brigitte Bardot playing solo banjo
I’m a hot green chile from New Mexico!
(banjo solo)

The sun goes down on Walden Pond
The birds nest in the trees.
The Empire marches on and on
But its strength is its disease.
The statues falling one by one
A new day slowly dawning.
And I can’t wait for it to come
I’m so damn tired of crawling.

Chorus:
I said go, go, go—be more like Thoreau.
Go, go, go—Henry David Thoreau!
Like Hank Longfellow drinking with Ralph Waldo
Or Lee Trevino putting it in the hole
And Merrill Markoe getting a Standing O
Or Puerto Rico getting statehood, you know
Fred Hampton said it best, “Power to the People!”",11,0

Got an idea? Build it up. Got a great plan? Build it up
	All your heroes and all of your goals
	Then watch it all come crashing Down again 

For all of your struggles to get through the day 
You'll find an obstruction to get in your way 
Birdstrike and dog doo and a car on the path.
You can't find your glasses and your notes have all gone

	Got an idea? Build it up. Got a great plan? Build it
	Up all your heroes and all of your goals
	And watch it all come crashing Down again 

A late running train, as there's leaves on the tracks
Your cats just had kittens and your sofa’s collapsed 
Oh hell!
There’s a hole in the path that you just didn't see
And don't mention the puddle you were standing right next to 

	Got an idea? Build it up. Got a great plan? Build it up
	All of your aims and all of your plans
	Then watch it all come crashing Down again 

Your boss got a pay rise of twenty per cent 
While you got fuck all and you can't pay your rent 
But the corporate ladder is a long greasy pole 
And the Higher they climb the harder they fall down again
I see it, I feel it, I live in the real world
There's nothing to shout about
Just the same old shit 

Birds and bees, Germs and trees 
Everything is Beautiful 

These little boxes they push us into 
From birth to grave in boxes we’re contained 
This one means your this and that one means you're that 
So everyone is kept apart

Fruit and fowl, Shark and Owl
Everything is Beautiful 

Same divisions, different reasons 
Round and round in a powerplay game
Pollution and production, divide and rule
What's mine is mine and I’ll have yours too 

Deep and wide, Slugs and Slime
Everything is Beautiful 

The mountains, the oceans 
On land in sea and sky
It's all there, it's not yours
So fucking grow up
Designer drugs, designer clothes, they make me sick
The world is built around designer lunatics
You're just like everyone, there's nothing on your mind
I have to share this world with people of your kind

	I was born for a better world than this one
	I was born for a better world than this
	I was born for a better world than this one
	I was born for a better world than this

Don't listen to your mum, don't listen to your dad
They set it up and say - Girl you've been had
(They set up the joke and say - ain't you been fucking had)
I think you're the one that's done all this to me
Give me that gun 'cause I want to set you free

	chorus

I see their false facades, I hear them telling lies
And when they're caught out - it's like some big surprise
I often wonder how they work out how to breathe
And I want off here 'cause I'm better than all this

	Ch.
Someone Said “This is the truth. All that we know is all that can be”.
Well there is more to reality than written in the books of man
All the unknowns in the small and large, and the deep and the dark, and the near and far 
We can see what we choose but it's clear as day we know nothing at all 

	Sun Rise, Night Fall
	all that we see is all we believe in
	A little knowledge is a dangerous thing
	Great authority from profound ignorance 
	Baseless superiority of the arrogant class 
	Who look the other way from the facts
	so I want to be the minority 

How about a little polish for the crown still resting on your head
The search for knowledge proves that this is who you are
They Know nothing, but They say a lot
Do you hear the people who think they have a greater understanding ?
Those Who take comfort in their knowledge Know nothing at all

	Sun Rise Night Fall all that we see is all we believe in
	A little knowledge is a dangerous thing
	Great authority from profound ignorance 
	Baseless superiority of the arrogant class
	Who look the other way from the facts
	so I want to be the minority 

Planets in orbit around the sun
Each little world round any shining star
has something that we have no idea about
Plants and animals, cities and towns 
Up in the Sky or deep underground 
hiding in plain sight or simply, as expected,
not there at all
It seems that I'm a rising star, brightest in the galaxy 
I light the sky when I Smile
Burning brightly. You see it's me 
And I cast Shadows endlessly 

No one has been so bright before 
There was only Grey and dark before I came to shine out 
Burning brightly. You see it's me
I light lives up When I sing

No scandal, drama or withdrawal 
Perfect in all Respects 
An ideal goal for all girls 
Burning brightly. You can be like me 

Shining brightly yeah while I'm still a currency 
Pretty young and beautiful. Yeah
Shining brightly, You Know it's me
I bring gladness endlessly 

Polished persona, social media
Looking gorgeous, Burning brightly
I'm Just perfect but I'm not real
I'm sitting alone now; you've finally gone
Taken all of my dreams with you; I hope that you'll have fun
Well you said that you hoped that we could, Still be friends
But I hope you fall under a bus; I'm trying to say

	Why don't you fuck off and die
	Fuck off and die
	Why don't you fuck off and die
	Fuck off and die
	Fuck off and die

I had enough of your schemes and lies, I had enough of your face
Hated the way you carried on, Put you back in your place
I don't even want to know you existed; I'll think of you dead
I'm so tired of being treated like shit, This is all that's left to be said

	chorus

You said it was good while it lasted, So why couldn't it go on ?
You said you feel I'm more of a sister, You're taking the piss
If you behaved like that with a sister, They'd lock you up
I was just food for your ego, I hope you fall under a truck

	Chorus
Sometimes when the mood strikes you
You can walk for miles and simply wear a smile 
If the sun is out or the rain falls down
You can still walk out to see what’s all around you 

	There are the birds and trees
	And all the rocks and plants with the sky above 
	When you make your own way along the path
	You never know what delights there are
	Around the corner 

Visiting an unknown place
Brings the joys of life into your heart again 
If the sun is out or the rain falls down
You can find new things you didn’t know surround you

	There are the birds and trees
	And all the rocks and plants with the sky above 
	When you make your own way along the path
	You never know what delights you might find
	Around the corner 

Sometimes when the mood takes you
You can walk for miles and simply wear a smile
When the sun is out then the rain falls down
Proper boots and coats help to see what’s all around you 

	There are the lakes in valleys and all the Hills and streams with the sky above 
	When you make your own way - along the path
	You never know what delights there are
	Around the corner
I sat alone; All by myself you know
Not many people around me

I can sit and think; And I can see the sea
And I see fish as they talk to themselves

I know that I'm happy here

I can't stay all day; Soon I'll go back home
I'll be back in more familiar surroundings

I don't mind being alone; I feel more comfortable

With no-one else in my hair

I'm at peace wherever I am",8,0

What will we humans be
In a thousand years?
We aren’t even on
Kardashev’s scale

It’s far too late
Humans already failed
We make our fate
Sailors of the mind
Shackled by time

Dancing through empty forests
Gazing upon the sixth great extinction
Oceans can only be seen by sophists

The earth will be swallowed by the sun
Scientific prophets have become soulless

What will we humans be
In a thousand years?
Could we even handle another?

Civilizations are too domesticated
Captivated by the televised fears

To ever question their Gods or peers
What will we humans
be in a thousand years?

Peace is not an illusion... Peace is not an illusion...",20,0

they say blood is thicker than water 
they'll give me something to cry about
and then beat me till I'm smothered
is this what life's about

conditioned and satisfied 
to be the child you love
and when I develop problems you just
you just dodge responsibility of them

growing up in fear
despite of what you hear doesn't make you fun and quirky 
it makes you all fucked up

butterflies and trust issues are one and the same
ill never lie or cheat you as long as I'm filled with pain
a child in ajar cant be heard when it screams
I try to say I love you but all I feel is hate

they say blood is thicker than water
but it just feels the same
I've been screaming all my life but you tell me to be tame 
been locked in this room for a million years or so
cos every time I try to go
 I'm right back where I started
(talking) all right bump that shit up to one maybe. yeah that works better.

(singing) I've been in my own head a little much
I guess I'm really starting to lose my touch
I don't know what's going on
I've been a little short tempered 
I don't know to express with words how much
how much
I

there's no worse feeling in the world 
then feeling like you cant trust anyone
feeling like you don't feel love
and feeling like your heart cant feel at all

I don't even know what to say
than maybe I'm not ok 
at all

relying on distraction too much recently
I don't know what to do 
its been really getting to me
its getting harder to sleep

I wake up two or three times a night

this part's not supposed to rhyme 
I just don't feel alright

every nights getting harder 
to go through

but I've been here before
I knew

I feel like everyone's about to leave 
like I'm the problem

and maybe I am

feeling like a weight holding you down
maybe you should leave me behind for now

and I'm not sure what to do
but maybe for a while 
I shouldn't be with you
I see this girl in my sleep 
its starting to terrify me

she's always crying 
she's always crying

hey brain what does this mean 
its really starting to fuck with me

I'm starting to wonder is she even real or
did I make her up

what is this about
I cant tell what I
 am on about

I gave her a name

it reminded me of a song called ""she""
so I named her lemongrass
so I could

visit her in the night 
a bit of a break from the nightmares

we'd have conversations about whatever (and nothing at all)

I'm not sure if she's real or not
but in my head she's a pleasant thought

she gets me through it all and I'm not even sure if she has a name
so I gave her one

I'm not sure 
what this means or if its
just a figment
or a distant memory but I

keep moving forward
I'm not sure what to say
and if I've covered it all
I would like to decay
these late nights are getting longer
they're getting harder to get through

I'm feeling it harder than I've been wanting to
its getting harder to breathe
but I've been getting by I guess 

its been getting longer but ill get by I guess

I feel so detached from the world
that I can make an island from it all

I'm not sure if I'm doing fine or if I'm about to lose it all

is everything around me fading really fast or am I
losing my grip on it all

am I just losing it all

you're an awful piece of shit
but I guess I cant get over the fact you're my dad

you've been ruining my life for so long

don't think I can fully detach
from the fact you are a part of me

I hate the mannerisms I picked up from you
the loved that I picked up for you
the hard parts I've gone through

I even picked up your 

drinking problems 
and all the extra things that really make you shine
they're now mine

I really fucking hate you
that you're my dad

its not my fault that I ended up just like you
that I ended up quite like you 

but I wish I wasn't anything like
been sitting in this empty room
contemplating why I'm still here

but I cant wait to get along with it 
cant wait to get along

I've been sitting alone in this empty room
trying to figure out what I did to you

what I did wrong and why you wont respond

cos every time I try to look back
i just feel more alone

I've been looking forward for so long 
cant stop looking at the past

cant stop even thinking back
at what I did wrong
I cant stop thinking about

Strophe 1
Isch bin de Jerome unn isch bring dir viel Pain.
Wenn de net die Fress haltscht, geb’s was uff die Zähn.
Dei Mudda is sau hässlisch unn dei Vadder aach.
Dei ganz Famillisch wohnt in meinem Arsch.

Isch kaaf mir e Mixery unn dann besauf ich misch.
Dann besuch isch noch dei Schweschda uff em Straßestrisch.
Dann fahr isch bei de Megges, scheen in de Drive-In.
Dei Bruda gebt mir de McRib, ei yo, so muss das sinn.

Isch bin de greeschde Gängschda in Kusel.
Isch hann die meischde Bitsches und sauf de meischde Fuusel.
Isch bin schonmol verhaft genn uff em Bockbierfeschd.
Doch isch scheiß uff die Polizei unn uff de ganze Reschd.

Mei Vadder hat e Audohaus, also hall die Bagge.
Isch häng do mti de G’s rum, net mit de Kanagge oda Spagge,
weil die gehn ma uff de Sagg.
Isch leb illegal und geb net eener Fuck.

Isch bin de geilschde Gangschda, weil misch jeder kennt.

Mim Kevin unn mim Joe sauf isch bis zum Abfack.
Isch bin de Jerome, mei Freinde nenn misch aa Bapsack.

Lautre is die geilschde Stadt, do geen isch in die Naachtschicht.
Du derfsch mit ma schwätze, wenn du e geili Fraa bisch.
Wenn de disch benemmsch, dann nemm isch disch mit hemm.
Do mache ma dann rum unn dann kansche widda geyhn.

Got your baby mama in my Caddy
Now we're gonna smoke a little fatty
Wizard101 with her daddy
Got her grandma lookin' like a baddie
And her mom look like candy
Sweet, sour, gone like the kiddies
Now her daddy lookin' at me funny
Like we weren't just buddy-buddy

Alright, no more playing around
I stole your mom's thong, now I'm going down to Pound Town
Now I'm coming over to your girlfriend
Put my three-incher in her back end

No more games, you're a lame, that's a shame
Pussy so good I think I'll post her on my main
Now I'm running out of bars to spit
I don't give a shit about the shit that you spit

Oh shit, now I gotta take a piss
Saw your granny down the hall now I had to throw a diss

I'm not done, I just had to fuckin' think
'Cause I threw all my rhymes down the sink

Okay, I'm done.
They got a real man on the beat, making rips and losing hoes.

I shared my life, now I look like a fool
I really let you use me up like a tool
I looked at you like you were a precious jewel
Took it all back, man that wasn't very cool

All those nights we spent talking on the phone
Now I'm spending all those nights alone
Man, I miss you and it's making me sick
And I miss it when you hopped on this

Dick and balls
Shaft and testes
Now I'm getting very limp
I guess you can call me the Limp Pimp

I pour my heart and soul out everyday
I guess you really never felt the same way
I guess it's really true what they say
That nice guys always end up having to pay

I wish I could get all my time back
I wish that there was a life hack for that
But what we had wasn't all that special
But loving you was like a mind wrestle

But to me, you weren't just another chick
Loving you wasn't just another trick
Man, I miss you and it's making me sick
And I miss it when you hopped on this

Dick and balls
Shaft and testes
Now I'm getting very limp
I guess you can call me the Limp Pimp

I guess that's just the way it goes
Will she ever smarten up?
Bitch, nobody knows!

She likes the big, fat cock
Sucking it all over the block
She likes the big, fat cock
Sucking it all over the block
She likes the big, fat cock
Sucking it all over the block
She likes the big, fat cock
Sucking it all over the block
She likes the big, fat cock
Sucking it all over the block

That was a re-re-re-re-real man production!

A-ha-ha-haaaaaa!
Oh yeah!
Let's get it!

I don't know why you wanna sit
Instead of taking a fucking hit
Come on, now baby let's get lit
You're acting like a little shit

I think I'm fucking 'bout to go
You're acting like a little hoe
So badly, you don't even know
Now, shut up bitch and hear me glow

I fucking gave you everything
I even got you fucking rings
I think I have a right to sing

That bitch over there gets a pass
That shit your man makes is so ass
I make some shit that has some class
They say nice guys just finish last
Just shut up, bitch and take this cash

Hold on, I never said turn the beat off

That's right, you bitch there is some more
You're just a stupid little whore
Music career about to soar
My left ass cheek is so damn sore

Bitch, I don't have the fucking time
To sit around and write a rhyme
I don't want to commit a crime
Fuck it, I'm gonna make you cry

I hope you get stung by a bee
Or maybe even fucking three
Or maybe even break your knee
Or even fall out of a tree
They say that karma is B
I-T-C-H, I guarantee
Come on, now bitch what about me?
I don't do all this shit for free
This drama shit is so petty
It's gonna make me fucking scream
And then I'll make you fucking see
All of the shit you did to me
All while we watched Nanny McPhee
We even went out overseas
I even made you a trustee
I even got my damn degree

I was just kidding about that last part

Oh bitch, you really think I'm done?
The best is really yet to come
You really must think that I'm dumb
Okay now bitch, I think I won
I'm having lots and lots of fun

It's funny you think my shit's lame
Because this shit is not a game
I'm 'bout to take my fucking aim
I'll see you when I rise to fame
Oh yeah!
Let's get it!

I don't know why you wanna sit

Come on, now baby let's get lit

When I hit the ground
You laid a mattress down
It was gold with feathers
I tripped and remembered

When I hit the ground
You laid a mattress down
It was gold with feathers
I tripped and remembered

Take me by the hand
Hand in hand
Hand in hand.
So you brought me here
To this open road
By myself

My hands are empty
My feet are scratched and bruised
This body used

And it’s you

I know there is a reason
Why you kept me alive
All this time

And through parting waves
Led by your fire
I rose higher

And it’s you.
Elusive
I’m just above the surface of
Melding
Into the reflections of
This memory

Elusive
I’m just above the surface of
Unravelling a
Synthetic environment
That slips through my hands

Beneath the surface of these whirlpools
I can see you in their patterns
I can hear all your reflections 

Scattered fragments of the past
Shattering like molten glass
Water lilies grow on my skin 
As I am becoming

Scattered fragments of the past
Shattering like molten glass
Water lilies grow on my skin
As I am becoming.
Now, have we seen the best of us yet
Echo on my mind
Surrender. Resist
I called that right away, it figured in my head
I know it seems, it’s already said
But my heart beats harder every time you stray

Now I’m chasing this one over
I get so nervous every time
Nobody wants to lay there awaiting morning chorus cries
I called that right away, it figures in my head
But my heart beats harder every time you stray

Our love comes back, I know
From somewhere I don’t even know it’s gone
Still my heart beats harder every time
Our love comes back, I know
I just sat and sulked until I walked it back
Our love comes back
Still my heart beats harder every time you stray
My heart beats harder every time you break.
By yourself
Finalise
We’re climbing down
We climb aligned
You see your bedroom
You see your line
Couldn’t see
The side you hide

You’re coming down
I’m on your side
It’s further out
Go arm in line
I won’t ever do you harm
I won’t love you any less
Just like the light
Keeps the line.
So it is
That the truth be left to live
Inside this home
We no longer call our own

Know this
In this parting there’s a gift 
To find, alone
All that we have now outgrown 

Into the open
We only meant to stay a while
The truth has spoken
All we need to get into the open

Know this
In this parting there’s a gift 
To find, alone 
All that we have now outgrown

Into the open
We only meant to stay a while
The truth has spoken
All we need to get into the open 

So it is
That the truth be left to live 
Inside this home
We no longer call our own 

Into the open 
We only meant to stay a while
The truth has spoken 
All we need to get into the open.
This January won’t feel as heavy
In time, with time

That’s OK, I’m not ashamed
It’s all in our hands
And as it breaks

I see you come into view
You’re mine this time

And all is new
My hands hold true
It’s all for you

I see you and how you grew taller
What shall I call her?

By my side somewhere to hide,
This mountainside

I see you

心一雫

LIFE IS SHORT  ジキルとハイド 潔く散り行くタフなプロジェクト　
波島の暴君　欲しい物は奪いさる　明日に消え行く今を生きる
時を腐らせず修練を続ける 天賦の才に勝るIQとライミング
日々是鍛錬を忘れず怠けず　知識と苦悩をCanvasに混ぜこむ
急いては大局を見誤るぜ兄弟　慌てず倍速で紐解いてく結界
繰り返し鍛える金属の様に　努める力は孤独と共存する
他力を望まず　苛つきを否定せず　上辺になりそうな自分を戒める
溜まっていく鬱憤　真っ黒な心　焦っては自ら闇に落ちる　
切れる事を知らない言葉の弾薬　剥き出しの感情は必ず伝わる
日照りは続く情け容赦なく　いつかの死は必ず俺達を分かつ
心の隙間　一瞬と謳歌　人間万事塞翁が馬
起源を訪ね新しきを知る　富嶽三十六景　心一雫

アドヴァンス　プログレス　愛国の残像　FAR EAST ATTITUDE SUPER NOVA
Summer Rain Gold Pain

早くなる鼓動うるさい張り裂けそう　目玉キョロキョロ中　パッパー
月にGood luck するミーヤキャット　焚いた大麻たった今ただいま
解き放たれる時の呪縛　空間と五感にドカンと一発
ほらほらお前も素直になれよ　やってない奴の言葉は無視
ため息の数深く吸い込む　吐いた分ちったぁ楽になる
溺れるかもーしくは気付けるか　神じゃなく宿主に試される
物質の性質を肌で感じる　いや、ナマで感じる
浴びる太陽　水の有り難み　革命をもたらす青い光

夢から覚めたと思えば
ここはどこ？映画
のようなワンシーン
trip x02 現実逃避

副作用、後遺症、OD  ダメ絶対は嘘ですよあれ
用法、要領、症状、状況　情緒に処方　金のなる木
バルキリーみたく半信半疑　だが決断は迫られるから
天国に行くか地獄に行くか　ロシアンルーレットみたいなもん
びっくり玉手箱　奇想天外　開けて後悔したって遅い
生きづらいだろ何をベットする？　お前の命と時間が対価
快楽を求めすぎればジェンガ　つめなくなれば雷が天罰
何がメンタルヘルスケアだよ　不適合ぶち込んで終わりだろ？
リプチオシン 推論システム

未曾有は突如　今日を消した

音は白い追憶　五線の上　現在は他人の葦を踏む群れ
多様は退き　感覚は無造　心血も遠のき　絆す思想
うっ血が近く　眩暈の連続　すえは、六腑と、人工臓器
短命を持す　幼蛇の本懐　未来は犯されてく為じゃ無い

桃源へ続く道　探しては拾う　心の傷み
芽を摘み　造語を並べ　お偉がた常套　逸らす眼
疑う情け　疲労の時勢　笑えないジョークに　傷も増える
失くして気付く幸　メトロポリスが未だに気づかず妄信

受けた非合理　何処に寄りかける幸福　記憶は障壁
恐怖になぞり　目の前を阻み　これ迄での欲や周りの色まで打ち砕かれてく
嘗ての花　十薬に水をやる以外　何もいらない　息できる術　
残された秘薬に躊躇もあり　右手がぶれる

自己憐憫　この手から離す　エビデンス　同胞も研ぎ澄ます
知性を愛す　理想を捨てず　君にも宿せる　
想いはIChIzを塞ぐウイルス　不知なまま　奪わせない　オルガスムス
緊張の骨に縋る肉と皮膚　物質に保つ心肝

受けた非合理　
今に見出せる幸福　記憶を糧に
明日への信用　
外は異常に　未だに妄信している
身体を持たず
十薬は咲いた　季節教える成長
消す不安

答えは一つや二つではない

心こそいつも貴方の為に

この先も見つめる本心

向かうは快気　行動は常に覚悟を
魅せて進んでる化学と共に
自身もいづれ　熟知に触り
考える葦は風にそよいでく
確かとはCoNFi DENCE 全う
遺す人望と空の金庫
秘薬は貴方に術を差し出す
見出だす　そこで光が待つ
Marshall V

炸裂する検体　精霊のマントラ
憂き世との絶縁星座の真下
星のかけらで出来てる我等
俺もお前も前世の彼等
真昼の慟哭　明日への飛礫
頷き反証解けない謎
失っていくモラル現実補強
今生に残したい手前勝手なEGO
俺という形に収まりきれない
雷公　雲　空　時雨を断ち
ペガサスオリオン並進対象
愛国の弾丸　黒のスコーピオン
傲慢が表面を飾りきる前に
揶揄いに抗い愛を吐き出せ
宿命の前では契りなど儚い
雨の中の涙のように
Envy Rain

善悪の判断　横文字のカルチャー　わかるか？これはダウナーの挽歌
感情の欠如　Best of Best  なんてはなから気にせず好きにやらせろ
滅多刺しにする　動脈をさけて　産まれてきたことを後悔させてやる
ワタシは誰なのか？むしろそれも愚問だ　クローンが出来たならお楽しみの時間だ
悲惨な結末は避けて通れない　お願い神さまおぉー笑わせるな
泣きっ面に興奮　硬い赤のロープ　お前の沈黙を語ってみなよ
絶望のふちに立たされた人間は　哀れで滑稽だ　許しをこうがいい
家畜の反抗は死に値する　病みつきに染みつく猟奇的狂気

* Where Do We Come From?
  What Are We?
  Where Are We Going?

- JINMU BLACKNOTE

戸惑いがお前の心に住み着き　いつしか臆病と生きる微温湯の日々
内掛け　魁　真を芯とし韻を定め　俗世から離れてお前の内側へ向かえ
銃刀法違反のフレッシュな転生繰り返し　情け　血と汗引き連れ　鬼と成れ
妬みや僻み陰口ネガティブはエナジー　怒りの河を渡り征く日本刀の化身

過去やしがらみに縛られるなんて愚かだ
飛び出せよ　その鎖を引き千切って行けよ
君が本当に飛ぶ事ってやつを望むのなら
誰も止めることなんて出来やしないよ

音の輪郭に殉国の言霊を宿し　言葉の科学に内面の解を得るアサシン
下手くそながら全てを連れて行こうと踠き　ここに紡ぐ愚かな二律背反の旅
偏見と速断を避け雑念組み合わし　食わず嫌いな腕組みのお前の壁を砕くぜ
点と点結び線からやがて円となり　時を経て然るべき¥と縁は実は隣人
孤独も続けりゃ孤高に成り得る　実に一縷の理解者 同胞の勝利

暗室に蝋燭　横たわる彫刻　静寂の最中糸が切れた音がした
なんとも、呆気ない幕切れだろう　早く次のモノを用意せねば今すぐに
溜まる欲求　に絡むロープ　紫に溶ける　赤いRose
寄生し花咲いたパラサイト　抗いのない
殺戮の衝動は確実に凶暴さを　増し騙し騙し世に溶け込む
まるで仮面を被る道化のように　表裏は不一致どこまでも不謹慎
痕跡は残さないまるで不審火　ワタシの楽しみを邪魔するでない

食物の連鎖は　黙祷はいらない　もう後戻りなど出来ないのだから

今日も世界は残酷で　振り向きもしないで　今に音を飛ばしてくれ　今に心揺らしてくれ

＊Time Erases Everything
＊Before you were, or any hearts to Beat",20,0

Silent shallow boat for a man’s last cruise
Algae water leeches rot the soles of his shoes
All the stolen property onboard his craft
Makes the boat and his heartbeat that much heavier

No telling where he is but I can tell you where he went
Drove into a swamp where he was shortly shot to death, by
1830 cops and their 1820 guns, he
Bled out in the water and then got eaten by the swamp

out of All the stolen goods none got back to their homes, 
Didn’t know the owners cause theres no names on them
Didn’t hand them out cause what good could that do, but at
Least we feel safe now that one more man is dead

صبحت عالفجاري
ثارت تنزف عالفلوس
راجلها كي البوهالي
عايش عالة كي الفيروس
جو باڨي البنات من تالي
ركبت في الكميون
و غطّت راص كلاه صهيدي
البرد و برشة هموم
تلمّو عالبرّاد و غنّو
باش تدفى ليدين
ڨبل مايجيهم مولى الباش
و كلبو عم حسين
و يبدى نهار صياح
طياح كتاف طياح قدر
نهار تموت فيه ألف أنثى
باش يعيش ذكر

الشمس في ڨلبو صارت
هم ڨالو جا وڨت فطور
غمّس بالخبز البايت
ياغرطة و التّاي يدور
جو أصحاب الشركة
هزّو الغلّة و حطّو شقف
الّي جاباته الأرض
و الي فوڨ الأرض
لكل تلهف
نبح الكلب وفات الرّاحة
تلمّو لبناويت
نبح و ما يرتاح
كان مايخرّج منهم زيت
طاحت شمس عشيّة
و رجعت بانت ليسوزي
الكلب تبركالله
يحسب في الغلة
و يصلّي عالنبي

لاااااا
دمّك في الكيّاس
دمّك طعمو مرّ
لعنة أرض و ناس

دمّك دمّك دمّك

في بلاد الاّزم فيها تحرق كبدة يا معدة
يا إما في فلوكة باللّيل
بلّي تعيط تبقى ساكت
تحلم و الحلمة الي تناكت
فمك مكمّم و بدنك مسمّم

بلي تحكي تغني ترابي مش تا يحسو بيك
في حرب أخرتها تضرب روحك بالشيميك
بلّي خذيت شهايد بلّي عشتو بلّي قريت
النفس يولّي زايد وقت الحلمة ماتت فيك
بلّي تلقى الهربة في الموزيكة و في الفيراج

For when the sun comes up I’m underground 
For when the sun comes up it’s a kick in the head 
For when the sun comes up I’m better off dead 
For when the sun comes up I’m your lost boy 
For when the sun comes up I can’t be fed
For when the sun comes up I don’t have a choice 
For when the sun comes up I’m your lost cause 

And you’re not helping
If you had a name, it’d probably be close to something like Van Helsing 
 
And I don’t wanna see the sun 
Because I know I’m just a pain the neck 
To see you turn away from the sun 
To see you bleed would mean everything 
To walk the walk of the damned 
And take hold of the devil’s hand 

For when the sun comes up 
If the sun comes up 
For when the sun comes up 
If the sun comes up 
For when the sun comes up 
If the sun comes up 
For when the sun comes up 
If the sun comes up
How do you live when you live like that? 
Won’t go out today won’t ever do that 
Too nervous and sad to ask for help 
Just leave me in bed I don’t feel well 

I’m on a winning streak of being a loser
You don’t have to cry because I don’t wanna die 
I’m on a winning streak of being a loser
You don’t have to cry because baby I don’t wanna 

I’ve always had problems like this 
If I ever go out everyone can see 
That responsibility means nothing to me 
That nothing will ever change 
That I’ll be like this 
That I’ll die the same 

I’m on a winning streak of being a loser
You don’t have to cry because I don’t wanna die 
a winning streak of being a loser
You don’t have to cry because baby I don’t wanna 

A winning streak of being a loser
A burnout today and a burnout tomorrow 
I’m on a winning streak of being a loser
A winning streak of",10,0

Today I put my head in my hands, cried over nothin’
Spilt milk and ruined plans
Today I took a walk on the wild side
Such brave talk...I thought of you and the tiger died

When I go to heaven will I remember how it feels?
When I go to heaven will I remember it was real?

Today I took myself to a happy place
The pain went away, everytime I saw your face

When I go wild, when I go wild and I could scream
When I go wild, will you be happy?
Tell me what you're feeling I'll tell you it's normal
Tell you it's human, that it ain't awful
Tell me what you're thinking I'll say that it's ok
You're only human, so don't be afraid

There was a devil in me yesterday, a devil in me yesterday
But don't worry, I'm ok
You're only human

Say what you gotta say, dance with the devil anyway
'Cos you're human
Say what you gotta say, knock him off your shoulder everyday
'Cos you're human

Tell me all your secrets I promise I'll listen
And I cross my heart, I'll keep them
Tell me what you're scared of I'll tell you it's ok 
Tell you it's human, so don't run away

There was a devil in me yesterday, running in my blood and through my veins
But don't worry, I'm ok
You're only human

Say what you gotta say, dance with the devil anyway
'Cos you're human
Say what you gotta say, knock him off your shoulder everyday

Say what you gotta say, devil gonna dance with you anyway

Hey...is it ever normal to question
Something that should feel...unconditional
‘Cause I’ve been holding some hesitation
 
And I’ve been feeling something I don’t know if it’s right Blinking in the daylight, dreaming at night yeah
Hey...is it ever normal to question?

I’m always giving it up for your love
I’m always giving it up for your love
And everyday is never enough
I’m always giving it up for your love
Over and over

Another day, another drama
Our life is like a circus, round and round
And I’m a puppet on a set of your strings
I can’t think, I can’t move, I can’t breathe
No I can’t breathe

See myself falling, never hit the ground
Every door is revolving, can’t figure it out 
Giving it up...
I know I feel things deeply, my emotions ocean deep
It’s all in my head, you say, so why can’t I think thoughts to keep? Sometimes I can feel nails under my bed
A sharp edge tears holes in all the words I said
And everybody’s looking at me, hide and seek

Nobody’s real completely, everybody’s pretending
And I wanna join in, believe me
But I can only speak when I’m singing

Sometimes I can feel nails under my bed
A sharp edge tears holes in all the light I shed

Whenever I don’t feel good enough
Shake, shake, shake the girl inside, wanna wake up the child
Whenever my tongue is tongue tied
Shake, shake, drink to my health and the words coming back
When I hear that voice in my head
Telling me I’m so bad, and everybody’s looking at me
There was a vision, in a dream
Caught a glimpse on my TV screen
Like a wave, mindless tide
Pushing out what I tried to hide

You don’t blind me anymore
I see holes in the fabric
You don’t blind me anymore

You’re a sun going down in the sky
Holding onto someone far behind
You’re a sun
A sun going down
You’re a sun
A sun going down

Caught a shiver, fever dream
Pull me out of this waking sleep
Open your eyes, swallow the tide
Easy as breathing how I leave you behind

You don’t blind me anymore
I see holes in the fabric
You don’t blind me anymore

You’re a sun going down in the sky
Holding onto someone far behind
You’re a sun
A sun going down
You’re a sun
A sun going down

Now the energy’s gone, what’s the point in holding on?
Let go of my horizon, let go

You’re a sun going down in the sky
Holding onto someone far behind
You’re a sun going down in the sky
Holding onto someone far behind
You’re a sun
A sun going down
You’re a sun
A sun going down

You’re a sun
A sun going down
You’re a sun
A sun going down
I want the sum of your parts
Give me your head
Give me your heart
And I want to peel your skin
Dive for gold
Let me in

Take me to your leader
Promise you’ll pull me into the fold
Say you’ll never leave me
‘Cause I never wanna be alone

I want to lose control
To someone else
Who’ll break my fall
And if I give you the key
Can you pull my strings?
Not be seen
Take me to your leader
Promise you’ll pull me into the light
See that I’ve been bleeding
Baby now I’m just a sorry sight
I don’t feel myself anymore
Don’t feel like the girl I was before
Stole her away in the night, left my pillow lighter than a feather, so small Small and naked and reborn
A brand new person, the sum of my parts

I don’t feel afraid anymore
All the things I hate don’t bother me now
Throw them away in the night, leave my pillow lighter than the shadow I was before
Before I met you I was so raw
Everything got to me
Everything sore

But you make everything better 
You make everything better
You make everything better
Better than before
I wake up at night
Daylight leaves me inconsolable
Magnified by light
My thoughts feel so uncontrollable
If I just sit tight
Will my darkest clouds evaporate?
Quiet, close your eyes
Listen to the radio
I get dark days you know

No one wants to hide
Bravery is so achievable
When your tongue’s untied
There is nothing too unreachable
Look into the sky
Every star is individual
Quiet, close your eyes
Listen to the child inside of you

Dark days you know
Dark days, I’m losing tomorrow
Lying there in the dark
On the inside, looking out
Playing scenes from old movies
Zoom in on the ugly parts tripping me up

Cut ‘em up, rearrange
Complete but not the same

Playing scenes from old movies
Black and white, in retrograde
Playing scenes from old movies

Sing yourself a new song

Took a long time to say
“Put away your burning scars”
In the cool light of day
I forgot the same old rhythms tripping me up
Tripping me up

Playing scenes from old movies
Playing scenes from an old movie
It’s just a scene from an old movie

Lying there in the dark
On the inside, looking out
Playing scenes from old movies

I'm a hedonist on a precipice
Taking existential elevenses 
Should I get back on this ride?
I can't decide

Ahead of this, where the pleasure is
(All the dressed up bestial revelry) 
And all conscience left denied...
It's a slippery slide

Do you you feel the air thickening?
You're breathing differently
When you're here I don't care, I'm a fickle thing
I'm breathing differently
I know I am

We could f**k
This up
We could really really f**k this up
Or we could suck
It up
It's up to us it's up to us

I can handle this, you're a catalyst
For chaos but I can battle this 
If we just ignore the signs
Then we'll be fine
The tricky bit will be to stick to it
If I slip with this I'm a hypocrite
If we both just tow the line
I'm sure this will be fine

Do you you feel the air prickling?
You're breathing differently
When you're near me I don't care, it's sickening
I'm breathing differently
I know I am

We could f**k
This up
We could really really f**k this up
Or we could suck
It up
It's up to us it's up to us

Leave please, I'm not doing this
Wait, stay! I'm not through with this

She took a job as a janitor at the madhouse
Painting, gardening, the odd-job to make summer last
But plumbing, oh no

That was more than she could handle, and because of that the whole place drowned
The coppers took her and sent her to Trinidad 
Where the riots were hitting the tv stores like wild fire
I saw her on a footage on cctv 

The slogan on the front of her t-shirt read ""Free my people from bondage"" 
A portrait on the back of Alain Prost

Because of that the whole place drowned
I have many problems, but my biggest problem is that I lie 
I lie mostly to myself, I always tell you my problems 
Fortunately for you, Unfortunately for you

I have many problems, but my biggest problem is that I lie 
Fortunately for you, Unfortunately for you

I have many problems  but I hide them behind stories 
So you don't have to worry 
I have many problems  but I hide them

And you may have to lay in cold water for a while
I'm on another titanic but I know how to swim now
Life repeats itself in a petri dish
I repent 
Life imitates itself 
And suddenly I don't know where home is 

Life runs on disposable batteries 
Always one step ahead 
Life running out of batteries
Out of air, breathless, steps aside 

I hated repeating myself 
How thin my life spreads, with the sun 
I never meant to change you 
But you changed

You want pretense? I will pretend : ""It is all the same"" 
In corruption in sin
Alone, with nothing left, when nothing was right 
I don't know what to do with life

Life repeats itself in a petri dish
I repent

Thrust every minute, stop depending on machines to live

In circles, black circles 

Would she do the same 
If she knew the world would end

Witches Ride
Well I’ve been on the witches ride
Observed every curse at my hide
Through the ebb and the flowing tide
Where dark hearts never reside

And I’m standing here with a choice 
And see fear is losing its voice 
For the circle of good will
Is beyond revenge’s bitterness pill

Yes I’ve been on the witches ride
Where dark hearts never reside
Harmonica Man
Harmonica man, harmonica man
I hear ya every morning, I see you in your van
I hear ya playing to the children
I see ya playing on the street
Say harmonica man, I really dig your beat

Harmonica man, harmonica man
Love the sound your making
Lord I really wanna dance
Makes me me wanna start shaking 
Doing gestures with my hands
I really love your music, harmonica man

Cats like you keep bringing in the joy
Playing music in the morning sun
You lift our hearts and the spirit of the street
With a little tiny harp that’s all
Hear the coins go clink as ya wind the punters up
Get the old folks dancing along
Vibing out the honey of the bluesmen yeah!
With a thousand beautiful songs 

Ba ba ba ba ba!  Ba ba ba ba ba!
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba!  Ba ba ba ba ba!
Whippet on the wing
When I was a boy I couldn’t dance or sing
So I started playing soccer met a whippet on the wing
Tried my best to mark him but he’d beat me to the ball
He bounced like a Roebuck and left me in the stall
He ran like the wind and he darted like a moth
Left me feeling dizzy and a slumping like a sloth
Turned me to pauper when I thought I was a king
Yeah that was the day I met a whippet on the wing
                 
Whippet on the wing, whippet on the wing
I tried to bring him down but like a Kangaroo he’d spring                          
I thought I was cool I thought I was king
But I soon learned to truth from the whippet on the wing

So they put me in goal cos I couldn’t get a hold
Of this long haired skinny boy whose name I wasn’t told
Whose crosses came over like arrows in the air
This kid was just too good man it didn’t seem fair
Put me on my backside put me in the mud 
Felt like I was destined to be chopping up wood
Made me think twice made me wanna learn to sing
Yeah that was the day I met the whippet on the wing

Whippet on the wing, whippet on the wing
I tried to bring him down but like a Kangaroo he’d spring                          
I thought I was cool I thought I was king
But I soon learned to truth from the whippet on the wing

Harajuku Punks
Out in Japan it feels so strange
Where pollenated cultures are all the rage       
See seventy seven revived again 
In a far off corner in a Japanese den

With the ancient gardens oozing out zen
That were manicured by quiet men
But those wondrous temples graced by the monks
Are a zillion miles apart from the city street punks

In Tokyo Shibuya at any time of day
Trip down Takeshita street you’ll see out on display
The punks of Harajuku the brave ones who dare
Ride the Kinki Nippon Railway as the old codgers stare

The punks of Harajuku have found their own kind
Gathering outsiders with the blues far behind
Dressed in chains and leathers feeding upon the shock
Housing all the misfits in this park of the old punk rock

In Tokyo, Shibuya at any time of day
Trip down Takeshita street you’ll see out on display
The punks of Harajuku the brave ones who dare
Ride the Kinki Nippon Railway while old codgers stare

Can’t Fool Love
You Can’t Fool Love, you can try as hard as you like
You Can’t Fool Love, to bring on a happy life

You can’t fool love, though you lie and cheat and despise
You can’t fool love, for love don’t hold any lies

Love is smart love has a heart, love can dissolve all pain
If you are smart cut to the start, come on get outta that rain
You can’t fool love, love will make it alright

Heartbreak Station
Heartbreak Station, theres a light left on for you
Heartbreak Station, where the rose time reflects the blue
You’re headed to heartbreak Station, only joy to tune into
Heartbreak Station, and there’s a room that you should use

Heartbreak Station, Its a cool destination
And the ones who kindly welcome you in
Are celestial kin and have known you forever

Heartbreak Station, such a cool destination
And the ones who kindly welcome you in
Are celestial kin and have known you forever

Heartbreak Station, theres a light left on for you
Heartbreak Station, where the rose time reflects the blue
You’re headed to heartbreak Station, only joy to tune into
Heartbreak Station, and there’s a room that you should use

I Cried 4 U
Though I’d only met you three times in my life
It felt like I’d known you so long
Though you were only nineteen and I was a child
I could see that your soul was strong 

Didn’t reconnect for many a year
Till both our mothers were gone
But got the chance to get to know teacher
For time it makes a good soul strong

I cried for you, I cried for you
Yes I cried for you, I cried for you

What a gift to know you pal, no matter how short or sweet
For good connection is everything, a precious gift the soul can keep

I cried for you, I cried for you
Yes I cried for you, I cried for youI 

For my cousin Michael RIP

Tides
Tides are the rhythm of the ocean
Echoing a message to the Earth
Tides are mystery in motion
Returning the mantra of our birth
The 7th wave of the affirmation
Will make it’s presence known for sure
The sleepers of a warring nation
Will have no time because there is no time

Love is the answer
I know you’re hurting and the cracks are beginning to show
It’s hard to ask for help in an all time low
But there’s one thing that you can’t see
That’s the power of you and me
And the answer is something, something you already know

What is the answer? 
What is the answer?

Friend surfing has it’s problems that’s for sure
Ten a penny not a sign of a decent cure
When Identity has gone without a trace
And you don’t recognise your own face
There’s one ray of sunshine, you’ll never have to chase

What is the answer?
What is the answer?
Love is the answer! 
Love is the answer!
My Wild Red Rose
At times on this path the fool in me did wander
Away from the grace to a dark cornered chair 
My sail at half mast, forlorn and un- useful
I turned to a self serving life of despair

But deep from within came a sweet song to save me
Through fire and through wind came my angel so fare

My wild Red Rose shall be with me forever 
Her faith and her beauty that I know so well
From morning till night she is constantly blooming 
For deep in my heart is my wild red rose

Your lightness of touch and call beyond her duty 
Wings of the angel, grace of the air
I love thee so much and trust you completely 
My Wild Red Rose such heaven to share

My wild Red Rose will bide in me forever
Her faith and her beauty both carry me on
Through morning to eve, by constantly blooming 
For deep in my heart is the wild red rose
Everybody’s Friend
Im everybody’s friend, but nobody’s sweetheart
Dreaming of the day that I find true love
Cos Im everybody’s friend, but nobody’s sweetheart
Lord give me a chance to find true love

Is there something I should do or something I should say
Why does no one ever seem to look at me that way
I guess Im everybody’s friend, but nobody’s sweetheart
Lord give me a chance, to find true love

Is there something I should do or something I should say
Why does no one ever seem to look at me that way
I guess Im everybody’s friend, but nobody’s sweetheart
Oh lord give me a chance, just to find true love
Thats why Im praying every day that you send me an angel
A lover of my own, to share the rest of my days

You didn’t teach me
I taught myself thru you
You didn’t heal me but I healed 
From the things that you do
We didn’t want each other baby
We wanted something so much more
To feel the rarest of feelings
That which opens all doors
Don’t shut them all too quickly
There might not always be more
I’ll spread your love so thickly so i can
Reminisce some more

Even if we’re done for
Even if it’s really sore
I’ll take it all 
Take it all 
Take it all

Sometimes it feels like I 
Could give it all up to be held by you
But that’s not all the time
No not all the time
Only when I can’t breathe
Only when I wanna believe
Only when it’s late at night
Only when it don’t feel right
Only when I touch my body
Only when I’m feeling naughty
Only when you’re far away
Far away
Far away

Only when I can’t breathe
Only when I wanna believe
Only when it’s late at night
Only when it don’t feel right
Only when I touch my body
Only when I’m feeling naughty
Only when you’re far away
Far away
Far away
I dance with myself 
Like there is nobody else in the world
I fall to the floor 
And I fill the whole room with salty tears

I swim out of the window 
And into the night
I am howling I am screaming 
I am glowing from inside 
Do I dare to feel this feeling

Oh how you looked at me
Like you’d forgotten why we’re here
Where we’re going 
What it all means
It might all mean nothing 
But you mean something to me

I squeeze a little tighter 
And suddenly I’m holding my own body 
There’s an empty space 
Where you once offered yourself to me

My mom knows I’ll be alright 
But she’ll be glad I’m home
She’s always casting spells for me
Working hard for me
Keeping guard for me

I swim out of the window 
And into the night
I am howling I am screaming 
I am glowing from inside 
Do I dare to feel this feeling
Oh she told me
She gets lonely
When the sky changes from day to night
That's when her demons come say hey
Dusk is always harder for my baby

So I told her 
Not to be afraid
That I’d think of her at that time of day
So I think about when her eyes light up
I think about when her eyes light up the world
The whole wide world
But the world don’t matter
When we’re looking at each other

Oh she’s got this way of making you feel like
You’ve lived a thousand times and never gonna die
And she shines illuminated by the strobe light
She smiles and everything will be alright
In the world
The whole wide world
But the world don’t matter
When we’re looking at each other 

But the world don’t matter
When we’re looking at each other
Sweet talking my way thru another funny day
I’m not here in the first place
I’ve been replaced
Haven’t quite met this new self of mine

Tell me it’ll all be fine
Tell me I don’t need to say the lines

I’m fine getting stoned alone
With all of this time
Maybe I’ll finally be mine

Dressing myself for the day 
Like I’m on my way to the grand parade
I catch my eye in the mirror 
And smile back at myself

Opened up some boxes that are filled
With pieces of me
All of those years trying to squeeze
Into boxes that didn’t fit all of me

I realise what it all means 
When I’m looking into mother's eyes
I’m looking into mother’s eyes

Cause I’m sitting in the corner of my mind
I don’t mean to sit here so much of the time
Tears rolling I’m shaking but I’m fine
I’ll be running into you all the time

I want you but I don’t want you to be mine
I want you but I don’t want you to be mine
Feels like the paradox of my life
Feels like I’ll get there one step at a time

We’ve been balancing on the finest line
Loving you’s the cure and the crime
Loving you’s the cure and the crime

The words are there they’re knocking at our teeth
I’m feeling bare and hot head to feet
I’ve got nowhere to go and no one to meet
I see it now I see my heart beat
I see it now I see what I need
To be sitting in the corner of my mind
To be sitting in the corner of my mind
Sitting in the corner of my mind
Sitting in the corner of my mind
Sitting in the corner of my mind
Sitting in the corner of my mind
Sitting in the corner of my mind
Be brutally honest
Be brutally honest to me		
With my whole world as your witness
Lay it all on me

I don’t want you to hold back any little thing
I’m ready to have my heart broken

I’ll blow wind in your sails 
I’ll even walk you to the door
But please tell me 
What you really think what you really think

I think I need your words 
To feel like daggers in this love
For only then could I give up 
The hope in my heart

For each time that I try
To put out my hope
A little flame lingers
And I’m back on your door

So be brutally honest to me baby
I know you can
It’ll help me to get out
While I still can

How to get out of love
How to get out of love
How to get out of love
How to get out of love

I’ll blow wind in your sails 
I’ll even walk you to the door
But please tell me 
What you really think what your really think
Of me 
Of me 

How to get out of love
How to get out of love
As if it wasn’t hard enough
How to get out of love

I guess i’m just a little drunk 
On a tiny piece of hope
And i wonder if it’ll ever really go away
Has it started or is it already over
The way you looked at me 
Made me want to believe 
That there’s something

Take me to bed 
And do the things that we said
We wouldn’t do
But what can you do
When it’s too hard not not

It’s heavy and it’s light as air 
You know it I’ve seen how you stare
You’re giving me something rare
Oh how it’s been fuelling my flare
How beautiful to really care

Lie down on that bed of clouds 
I wanna come down from spinning round
Standing too close to fire
Wanna play it cool but also wanna get higher
I’ll be there for you whatever you wanna do
I’ll be fine I’ll be fine
Let’s do it right this time

It’s heavy and it’s light as air 
You know it I’ve seen how you stare
You’re giving me something rare
Oh how it’s been fuelling my flare
How beautiful to really care
I want nothing
I want it all now
I’ve got a dirty mouth
I’m not gonna wash it out

I’ve got baggage
It’s got big wheels
I’ve got a little dog
Biting at my heels 

I’m not gonna heal you
Not gonna make your dreams come true
Don’t touch me
Don’t even look at me

I’ve got lazer beams
Coming out my eyes
Do you still really 
Wanna mess with me
Wanna mess with me
Wanna mess with me

I got tough cause I had enough
I was a girl with a big heart
And they really roughed me up
My body fell asleep 
When they took it away from me
But I got it back 
Now I do what I like with it
Do what I like with it
Do what I like with it 
Yeah

Show me your soft spot
Have some pillow talk
Your sweat tastes salty 
Your brakes are faulty

Watch the sky don’t feel shame
Talking back don’t feel shame
Saying no saying no saying no
Dressed up letting go letting go
Dirty mouth don’t feel shame
Stepping out of the frame
You’re not ready for the comedown
It’ll turn it all upside down

When it’s all over I’ll call you for company
That’s your medicine

I’ll be trying to come back to me
She needs me more than you do

I’ll be happy for you whether I’m there 
Whether you’re not
Whether we’re anywhere, anywhere
Anywhere, anywhere
Anywhere, anywhere

Always lonely in a crowd
I don’t always mean to talk so loud
Tell the fishes I say hello
I’ll make some wishes and burn them in the snow

I don’t need a place in your happiness
For me to feel happy for you

I just want to see you smile
Whenever I can 
Whenever you let me in, let me in
Let me in, let me in
Let me in, let me in

Always lonely in a crowd
I don’t always mean to talk so loud
Tell the fishes I say hello
I’ll make some wishes and burn them in the snow
When you were dreaming I looked in
I saw everything 
I saw fresh new grass 
That’s growing it’s growing
You’ve got a big big heart
It’s showing it’s showing

I never knew you like that
It’s something quite special
I’m addicted to getting on your level

Never wanted to make it all blue
I just wanted to get into bed

I’m walking thru 
the sweet sweet memories
I keep for nights when I can’t sleep
I remember all the times we loved
I remember all the places we could only go
Just you and I 
Lovers by night
But when the day came 
We were back to the same

I’m a lover 
I feel it now
I’m a lover
Just never knew how
But now I got there
I’m a lover 
So let me love you
Whatever the weather

You’re trouble
It’s trouble 
But it bubbles right over
And makes me feel over the moon
You make me feel over the moon
You making me feel over the moon
You make me feel over the moon

I’m a lover 
I feel it now
I’m a lover
Just never knew how
But now I got there
I’m a lover 
So let me love you
Taking turns to draw a circle in the sand
Your hand quivers
And I shiver

On days you’d sail away 
I would try to find my own way
On days you’d sail away
I would try to find my own way home

Oh the loss of you 
The loss of you
Will haunt me through and through
Oh the loss of you 
The loss of you
Will haunt me through and through

Drifting driveby 
Shoot at anything that moves
Slowly sinking ship nobody can rescue

On days you’d sail away 
I would try to find my own way
On days you’d sail away
I would try to find my own way home

Oh I’ve been waiting for you
Waiting for you
To tell me where to go from here
I’ve been waiting for you
Waiting for you
To tell me where to go from here
Wake up 
I’m right here
Been howling
At you dear
A volcano erupted 
And the stars fell one by one 
And finally I’m done right
And it’s a kite trapped in my mind
But I don’t mind
I think of your hands on my body 
And they feel nice
Just one more night

And there’s love pouring out my eyes
And onto your plate
We’ve got it mighty fine
Whenever we like
There’s a velvet kind of mood 
And the pleasure’s like pudding 
And I’m winning and I’m sinning
Take a page from my dream 
That I’m living I’m spinning
The world it keeps on turning
The world it keeps on turning
So tender I’m ended 
Surrendered to you
So tender I’m ended 
Surrendered to you
I ache for you but it doesn’t paint me blue

I can’t help thinking about 
All of the perks of loving you
Even if I have to hold this love alone
Until it passes through
I keep thinking about 
All of the work I had to do
But it all fades away to nothing 
When I think of you

I’m sick with love it’s got me where it hurts
Got struck from above if only these things worked

I can’t help thinking about 
All of the perks of loving you
Even if I have to hold this love alone
Until it passes through
I keep thinking about 
All of the work I had to do
But it all fades away to nothing 
When I think of you
Yeah it all fades away to nothing
When I think of you

Would it be alright if we sat side by side
And didn’t say a single word
Just let ourselves drown in the sweet sunny silence 
And maybe we’d just know why it can’t be so

I can’t help thinking about 
All of the perks of loving you
Even if I have to hold this love alone
Until it passes through
I keep thinking about 
All of the work I had to do
But it all fades away to nothing 
When I think of you
Yeah it all fades away to nothing
When I think of you

It just fits so good it just works so right
It just fits so good it just works so right
Like you could never hold me tight 
Tight enough yeah
It just fits so good
It just works so right 
Like you could never hold me tight 
Tight enough yeah

I ache for you
I ache for you",12,>1000

Pas si claire ma planète,
Pas si nette ta silhouette.
Pas si nette ma planète,
Pas si chouette, t’es pas nette.

Quand je vois autour de moi,
Tous ces gens qui meurent de froid,
Que l’on dépouille de sang-froid,
Sans remords et sans débat.

Refrain

Tu ne vois pas autour de toi,
Tous ces enfants qui meurent de faim,
Qui n’ont de toi que des poubelles,
De ta consommation annuelle.

Refrain

La télé t’a bouchée,
Internet te rend bête,
Les applications te rendent con,
Le Facebook ça t’encroûte.

Refrain

Ne désespérant pas, mais pleurant pour eux,
Te voyant les bras croisés, j’ deviens hargneux,
Avec un grand soupir, je veux te dire,
Laisse en un peu, écoute un peu, ça ira mieux.

Refrain
In ihrem tiefen Gesang,
Heult sie oft und kräftig auf,
Sie liebt und lässt sich lieben
Sie gräbt die Knochen aus
Und stimmt ihre Ohren fein
Im tanzenden Mondlicht ein.

Wenn sie nicht in den Wald geht,
Wird ihr nie etwas passieren,
Und ihr leben wird nie beginnen.
Sie lebt in der Träne weiter
Sie lebt in der Zukunft und geht
In die Zeit zurück um uns zu finden
Vous avez bercé nos rêves de tendresse
En chantant, vos caresses apaisaient notre peur du loup.
Vous avez donné la vie le bonheur
Fragile et docile, la vie s’est pourtant lassée de vous.

Où êtes-vous maintenant, loin de nous, hors du temps,
Loin de tous ces tourments qui n’agitent que le vent.
Où êtes-vous désormais, libres et désarmées
Devant l’insouciance de nos souvenirs d’enfance.

Quel est ce butin fragile, qui s’endort et se perd à jamais,
Dans la nuit de l’exil, étrange vengeance des anges,
Qui n’ont su attendre l’heure, de vos cheveux sans couleur,
Qui n’ont su attendre l’heure de vos yeux remplis de bonheur.

Vous étiez notre courage, la douceur qui soulage,
Ô divins otages de nos ciels sans nuages
Vous avez aimé si fort et si longtemps
D’un amour si puissant que la vie s’est lassée de vous

Où êtes-vous maintenant loin de nous loin de tout,
Hors du temps, loin de tous les serments s’envolent au vent.
Oubliez-vous désormais libres et désarmées
Ce vent d’innocence de nos souvenirs d’enfance.

Refrain

Nous avons marché longtemps, ô si longtemps,
Épousant vos corsages, refuges de tant d’images,
Vous nous avez appris la vie et le soleil
Qui brille dans nos coeurs est celui de tous vos sourires.

Vous avez bercé nos rêves de tendresse
En chantant, vos caresses apaisaient notre peur du loup.
Vous avez donné la vie le bonheur
Fragile et docile, la vie s’est pourtant lassée de vous.
De Saint-Louis à New Orleans, au péril de mon exil,
Sous la violence du courant, j’emprunte ton lit très prudemment,
Au risque constant des tornades, sur ce fleuve dans le brouillard,
Je navigue sur ton histoire, où d’autres un jour ont vu l’espoir.

Ta veine de 4000 kilomètres, magnifique et destructrice,
Sournoise et généreuse, je suis ton mouvement,
Sur le fil du temps passé, de ses légendes presque oubliées
C’est de toute cette histoire dont je dois maintenant m’emparer.

Smoky water, je suis des tiens,
Big muddy water, tu es des miens.

Toi le bateau à aubes, qui navigue jusqu’à l’aube,
De rives en berges, porté par le lever de l’aurore,
Le temps s’écoule pourtant et je m’agite,
Mes sentiments soudains me submergent,
Dans les abîmes et tourbillons où je gamberge.

Être ou ne pas être, je suis et je ressens,
Tout ton charisme soudain, dans le courant,
Ruissellement du souffle de vie, de toi je dépends,
Mississippi, tu es le corps de mes sentiments.
Suivre ton chemin, sigue tu camino,
Folge deinem weg, follow your bath
Voir les rêves en couleurs,
Mira tu sueños en color,
Seh deine Träume in Farben,
See the dreams in colors

Prends ton envol, Take your flight,
Nimm deinen flug, Toma tu vuelo
Crois en ta liberté, en tu libertad,
In deine freiheit, in your freedom
Amore mio, Amore mio
Ora che non ci sei più,
I miei giorni non hanno un senso
Mi sembrano freddi
Spero, che tu sia, su altri sentieri
Il mio grande cuore, nel destino muore

Amore mio, Amore mio
Sei andata via, lontano da me
Lasciandomi solo, in acque torbide
Onde di, lacrime, m’invadono ma nulla potrà,
Affogare questo fuoco,
Che brucia dentro di me

Amore mio, Amore mio
Spero che languì, il tuo corpo e anima
Siano in serenità
Nel filo, dei nostri, amori infiniti
Rivedo ogni mattina, il tuo bel sorriso",13,0

In a hole in the ground there lived a Hobbit.

It was a spot that often became lively under moonlight. Fireflies blinked awake, and frogs warbled a slimy opera.

Blood streamed from her forehead and chin, wounds bestowed upon her by the reaching brambles of the forest. Again, she heard the cough of her sister’s infernal weapon, and her howl of frustration. She doubled her already precarious pace, knowing it would take her twin precious seconds to load the weapon again. \n\nThe forest’s undergrowth sped past; she leapt over root and stone. A branch spread the flesh of her cheek; she cried out but continued her sprint. In the distance, between the trees she saw her twin, rifle raised. The strange pale girl urged her legs to a final burst of speed, knowing that at any moment she would hear the sound of that accursed black dust jettison is deadly bite.  \n\nShe saw it then, a mass of fur and scale. There was no time for further considerations. She hurled her mother’s spear. There was the howl of an enraged beast, then a second roar, of black dust igniting, and a third, low bellow from the Wortuuk as it gave up its spirit. Woja’s legs gave way at the beast’s side and she collapsed.\n\nSoja’s shadow fell over her. \n\t“I believe this kill is mine,” she said, pulling a serrated dagger from her sash and grabbing the beast’s great horn.\n\t“I am afraid not sister, our mother\'s spear is buried in it\'s heart, I struck first,” Woja replied, grabbing great handfuls of the Wortuuk’s fur to help her to her feet.\n\t“And my shot is buried in its brain, I killed it!”\n\t“It was already dying!”\n\t“Silence,” a large man in hunting leathers stepped from the underbrush. “It seems once again you are equally matched, neither of you shall collect the horn of the Wortuuk today,"" Soja\'s guardian Kyllar said. Soja growled and stabbed her dagger into the beast’s wooly neck.  Woja shrugged and pulled her dagger from her own sash and went about skinning beast. She had not wanted the horn anyway.', 'Track Number': 1, 'Track Duration': '02:44'}, {'Track Title': 'The Mist Wreathed Shores of Ur Rising', 'Track Lyrics': 'God’s it was cold! Soja sat in the bow of the boat, Woja’s stinking animal fur about her shoulders. Reeking, lecherous sailors milling about. She cleaned her rifle to keep her mind busy, lest rage should over take her. Yet, despite the repetitive comfort of her task, her mother’s words, uttered a season ago in the great keep remained hungry, and continued to gnaw.  \n\nShe had been spying on her mother and sister. Why should Woja be summoned to a secret council and not her? From behind a wall length curtain, she had heard the conversation in hushed tones. Their mother was dying. This Soja had suspected. She had felt deep sorrow then, not for her mother\'s imminent passing, but for lack of grief. She had loved her mother, but Woja had been her mother\'s star, not her. \n\nMuch of the remaining conversation was so hushed she was unable to hear it. She heard enough to understand their plan: “take me home” and “barrow.” The crazy woman, she meant for Woja to take her back to Ur, if it were a real place at all, to be buried.  Then, her mother’s final words, clear as the midday bell, struck her like iron shot: “Do not tell you sister, she is not strong enough.” \n\nIt was a summer’s eve that Woja and her mother escaped the City of the Great Seat undetected by all but Soja. She had followed them into the woods at a distance. Her mother detected her, the confrontation with Woja had been violent. Woja was to be Jarl, and it was her duty to remain and take the great seat when it was her time. Father would be furious, as would the guardians. Woja would have none of it. \n\t“It is my duty as the eldest to fulfill our mother’s final wishes,” she said.\n\t“Those are her ways, the old ways!” Soja hissed, wiping blood from her nose, a token of their brief battle. “ Look!” she said, jabbing a finger to the distant city, “progression, industry, the Scire!”\n\tWoja looked to home, her strange, scarred face impassive. The white towers and walls lit with the glow of coal fire were impressive, yet within the walls many suffered, while the few, she included, lived in luxury.\n\tShe turned her back on the city, with its forward-looking yet backwards people and its cloud of coal smoke.\n\t“Come mother, we have a long way to go and your strength shall not last.”\n\t“What about father?” Soja said.\n\t“He’s not our father,” Woja replied, not looking back. Soja stood alone watching her family depart into the darkness of the woods.\n\t“Come along little one,” her mother called weakly from the trees.\nSoja had followed reluctantly, leaving small rune markings in the soil for Kyllar and Pjorlar, their guardians, to follow, ""She\'s not strong enough,"" echoing in her head.\n\n“Mother! Mother!” Woja’s cries cleaved into Soja’s reveries. She leapt up and rushed to the stern. Her mother had gone as pale as Woja, her eyes unfocused and filled with tears. She lifted a shaking hand to point off into the sea. There on the horizon, land rose up from the waters, dressed in silks of morning mist. She spoke in the old language then. “Home” she uttered, and her spirit departed.', 'Track Number': 2, 'Track Duration': '06:32'}, {'Track Title': 'Tangled Roots, Rusted Blades, Skeletal Remains', 'Track Lyrics': 'This was truly a land for the dead. Why would their wards travel so far and risk so much to come to this burial ground? At every turn, there seemed to be a raised platform bearing a skeleton in moldering garments or a tree’s hollow bearing the same. Tangled in the roots of trees was the evidence of great battles: bones, rusted swords and standards. When they camped in a cave, it was amongst the deceased they slept.  \n\nKyllar and Pjorlar, would never admit it to each other, but they both felt unease slowly work its way through their mental battlements, a fearlessness built from the brick work of warfare and mortared with the horrors witnessed upon the killing fields. Each day they wandered an endless landscape of woods and marsh, over which hung an unbroken and preternatural quietude. Somewhere, their wards, Soja and Woja wandered these same untamed wilds where even a battle-hardened man had cause to look over his shoulder. They were charged to reclaim their responsibilities, the Jarl’s stepdaughters. Should they fail, it would be better that they remain and join the rest of these nameless dead in their secluded moldering.\n\nThey came upon the barrows on the fourth day. Kyllar had never believed a word of The Woman’s tales, of which there were many. True, her adventures in The Underneath had been verified, and had brought trade between their two peoples. But her tales of a southern land across the ocean? A barbaric warlord beyond the powers of the great sleep, who raided this supposed realm?  Mounds of dirt the height of a guildsman’s manor, housing generations of noble dead? Madness. Until now.\n\t“I always believed The Woman’s tales, I am happy they bear some credence.” Pjorlar said with a grin. Kyllar grunted, shouldered his pack and trudged across a seemingly endless plane, where only the mighty barrows, plundered of their treasure many years ago, broke the horizon.', 'Track Number': 3, 'Track Duration': '04:58'}, {'Track Title': 'Lost in the Pines I. The Nocturne II. The Jortuuk III. The Tunnel in the Trees (Feat. Evergreen Rupe)', 'Track Lyrics': ""Woja was glad her sister had joined her on this venture. Though her grumbling was tiresome, the litter bearing their mother’s body was more that she could have managed by herself.  In the few days they had been together, Woja had noticed changes in her sister, her ever flowing skepticism in her mother’s past had seemed to dry up. Their daylong journey across the Barrow Lands had brought her to tears.  That had been the first great revelation.  The second had been the procession of spirits they watched glide across the waters as they waded from the island to Ur’s mainland. The latter, the Scire could never explain.\n\n“I don’t understand,” Soja had said that evening, as the sister suns, the girls namesakes sank below the horizon, Woja, pale and strange, followed by Soja bright and fiery. “The explorers father sent before we were born never told of this land. They said they found nothing but endless ocean.”\n“Our step father kills those who fail him, and they failed. They were frightened, so they did not tell the truth of their defeat. Did mother ever tell you of the defilement of the barrows?”\n“No.”\nWoja began. She told of the airships and the men who ransacked their ancestor’s precious riches. Of their mother who snuck aboard and struck a fatal blow to the flag ship, of a sprit storm that tore the fleet apart. The two remaining ships returned home, the vessels consigned to scrap, the crews, terrified of reprisal from their Jarl, bound to an oath of secrecy. \n\nWhen she had finished, she watched Soja stare into the flames of their campfire. A procession of cold moons, like the sprits they had witnessed earlier that day, chased each other across the night sky. Woja stood and walked to where land ended. She looked across the waters to the Barrow Lands. On those distant shores a campfire burned. Pjorlar and Kyllar no doubt. She smiled, her sister had been less discreet with her markings than she thought. Kyllar was here no doubt to save his neck, and reclaim his wayward charge, Pjorlar to reclaim his love. Brave, stupid Pjorlar. He would make a good husband one day. He had always believed her mothers stories.  She liked that about him. With sudden inspiration, she wadded out into the sea towards the distant shore of the Barrow Lands. \n\nNight was falling and the pines were growing thick. Kyllar swore as he hacked away at the reaching branches with a small hand axe.  Pjorlar had been unusually grim all day and it was bothering him to no end. There had been none of his songs, or usual fooling. Something had happened last night after he had fallen asleep. Before, they had sung songs and danced about the fire, quite drunk. Perhaps a throbbing head ailed him.\n\nThey camped in a clearing they found after tunneling with axe and sword through a particularly vicious patch of brambles, a guttering oil lamp their only source of light. It was a strange patch of ground, a near perfect circle with a wall of brambles all about. It reminded Kyllar of a pen, for some kind of animal. There was a hole in the ground at the center of the clearing, with a stream running into it. Neither of them liked the looks of it. It was deep, for the water made no sounds where it landed somewhere below. \n\nThe two men were asleep when the Jortuuk crawled from the blackness of the pit. It was hungry, but not enough to eat the flesh of a man. It breathed deep of the air, there were mothers near. Not with child, but they would do. It turned from the slumbering figures and loped through the tunnel made in the brambles. They had freed him, and would awake to the dawn, never knowing what they had unleashed upon the lands of Ur.\n\n“Beware, my little stars”\nThey both heard the voice born upon pine scented winds.\n“Mother,” Soja whispered then shook her head. No, she was dead, her body wrapped and motionless upon the litter. Woja set her end down quickly and rummaged through her satchel. Her hand returned clutching The Fang. With deft motion she twisted free The Tooth and attached the new, longer spear head to the shaft. Soja, also feeling the approach, set her side of the litter down, un-shouldered her rifle and loaded it. \n\nNo sooner had she raised the weapon to her shoulder that it appeared between the trees. A kaleidoscope of forms comprised of vileness and malignancy, a thing of teeth, eyes and tongues, circling slowly from tree to tree, waiting for its moment. \n\nSoja’s finger twitched, the rifle’s hammer snapped forth sending the flint home. The shot bellowed from the barrel and sank into the soft bark of a tree a meter from The Jortuuk. It leapt. Woja slashed with her spear. It cut strange flesh. A resounding scream forced both girls to their knees with hands over ears. \n\nThe Jortuuk chuckled. The part of it that had once been human urged the monstrous rest back into the woods, but that other, ravenous half refused to listen. It crawled, its twisted, fleshy mouth close to the earth, ready to taste flesh. Then it heard familiar words, words of horror and pain from long ago. Words that seemed to flutter as moths, and to which no amount of swiping or batting of mighty arms could repel. \n\nAt the center of The Fang, a glow blossomed into a blinding flower of light. Woja stood, spear raised above her head, The Fang bright as a star. The Jortuuk cowered before the mighty, purifying refulgence. Woja struck.\n\nSoja had wondered how her sister knew the path to their destination. Their mother’s sprit was with them, aiding them on their journey. She had warded off that creature with runes of banishment, given power to The Fang. Even now Woja muttered quietly, but this conversation had another party, and it wasn't Soja. \n\nThe trees about them were converging, weaving. Bark surrounded them. A rooted cathedral. At the end of this tunnel, the light of morning streamed."", 'Track Number': 4, 'Track Duration': '05:09'}, {'Track Title': ""Through Twilit Marsh They Sing Their Mother's Song"", 'Track Lyrics': 'The dawn found them trudging through a vast marsh. Soja took up a song. Woja stopped for a moment, realizing it was something their mother had once sung to them, so long ago. \n“Surely you would rather sing one of fathers battle hymns,” She said.\n“You mean step father’s?” Soja answered, pushing her end of the litter forward, forcing Woja to continue their march toward the imminent mountain range towering before them, white and gold in the early morning light. Soja took up the song once again, and Woja joined in. \n\nKyllar heard the singing from afar. Pjorlar would have taken it up too, had he not disappeared that night in the clearing. Kyllar doubled his pace, gods he was old.', 'Track Number': 5, 'Track Duration': '04:44'}, {'Track Title': 'A Trek Across the Spine / Festival of the Lost', 'Track Lyrics': 'No matter the season, the crossing was a dangerous one. Pjorlar had killed a large beast at the timberline. It’s flesh, smoked over a fire, filled his pack and would sustain him, while it’s wooly hide would ward off the mountain’s cruel chill. Thoughts of Woja kept up his spirits, though guilt of leaving Kyllar gnawed as well.\n\nIt had been many nights ago that she had appeared at the fireside of their camp on the Barrow Lands, her pale skin a-glow like an ember. Kyllar snored loudly on the other side of the fire, sleeping the sleep of the drunk. She had slipped under Pjorlar’s fur with him, her skin cold and shivering, her clothes wet with seawater. He held her and chided his love for running away, but soon understood the honor of Woja’s task. Her request of him however, was not so easy to accept. A parting kiss and a promise bound his heart to hers. He watched her wade off into the ocean.\n\nThe Spine was a maze of ice and rock, a glacial labyrinth, a trap of cold stone and bottomless crevasses. Yet despite this, he never felt waylaid, it was as if the wind or something residing within guided his steps. One day, after following a down slope he found himself at the edge of a cliff. Far below stretched a land of golden trees and glittering streams. \n“Go to the golden land south of the great mountain where my aunt resides and rules. Await me there,” Woja had whispered that night so many days ago. Pjorlar adjusted his pack and rifle and made his way down, singing a song his love had taught him.\n\n“You old fool!” Soja barked at Kyllar as they sped through the woods. Woja led them at a break neck pace through the forest. Kyllar’s breath came in sharp, wheezing gasps. If he survived, he would put away his smoking pipe forever. Close behind them, The Lost followed. A throng of tumbling forms, crimson eyed and mouthed, urged forth by a lust for new flesh to inhabit. \n\nKyllar was never a curious man, and it hadn’t been curiosity that had led him to enter the small stone building, but necessity. The rain had lashed him for days. Cold, wet, alone and with no end in sight, his sanity close to the breaking point, a nights rest in a dry place seemed an unfathomable luxury.\n\nHe had been sitting there contentedly, with a small fire and a pipe when Woja appeared at the door. He stared at her with disbelief. The gall of the girl! To lead him along these long months, only to suddenly appear at her leisure! A look in his eye stopped him from speaking. There was terror there, and she was not looking at him, but behind him. He turned and looked into the darkness finding himself staring into a face. \n\nThat face would haunt him for years to come. He had leapt and ran from the stone hut, charging past Woja, bellowing a guttural scream. He ran headlong into Soja who swore as they both tumbled to the ground. Forms began to pour from the door of the little building, more than the structure could have possibly held within. A firm hand grasped Kyllars arm and pulled him into the woods. They watched the figures spin and dance, a nightmare music issuing from unhallowed throats. Then the festivities were over and the hunt began.', 'Track Number': 6, 'Track Duration': '05:10'}, {'Track Title': 'Hark! The Whispering Dead of the Burial Lake', 'Track Lyrics': 'The Lost surrounded the lake, but could come no further. This was not a place for those between life and the great sleep. The lake was shallow and they walked the length of it, fog hovering over the surface and shrouding the glowing eyes, mouths, and twitching limbs at the lakeshore.\n\nA mighty and twisted tree appeared out of the mists. Woja knew their journey had ended, for this was the barrow of the all mothers. Kyllar stood at a distance saying nothing. He felt that to break the silence here would be to sin yet again against the law of this strange land.\n\nThe twins set the litter down and placed their mother at the trees roots.\n“Goodbye mother,” Woja said, uncovering her mother\'s face and kissing the exposed forehead. Tears streamed freely down Soja’s cheeks but she said nothing. Woja took up a song her mother had been teaching her during their long trek. The spirits of all those who resided there took up the song, a chorus of whispers permeated from the mist. By the songs end, the body was gone. Dawn lifted the gloom of that place and scattered The Lost back to the shadows.\n\n“Goodbye my stars,” their mother said. Soja gasped. Their mother had appeared, as had an earthen portal between the great trees roots. Through this the specter stepped, looked back once at her daughters, then, as a candles flame is snuffed out, both woman and door vanished.\n""Mother,"" Soja finally managed, ""am I strong?"" \nThe answer came as if from across a great distance, ""you are the strongest.""\n\nAs did the fog that surrounded Kyllar, obscuring what had transpired. When its last wisps dispersed only Soja stood there, her face streaked with tears.\n“My sister is not coming home with us.”', 'Track Number': 7, 'Track Duration': '05:10'}]","

Soja had followed reluctantly, leaving small rune markings in the soil for Kyllar and Pjorlar, their guardians, to follow, ""She's not strong enough,"" echoing in her head.

“Mother! Mother!” Woja’s cries cleaved into Soja’s reveries. She leapt up and rushed to the stern. Her mother had gone as pale as Woja, her eyes unfocused and filled with tears.

They came upon the barrows on the fourth day. Kyllar had never believed a word of The Woman’s tales, of which there were many. True, her adventures in The Underneath had been verified, and had brought trade between their two peoples. But her tales of a southern land across the ocean? A barbaric warlord beyond the powers of the great sleep, who raided this supposed realm?  Mounds of dirt the height of a guildsman’s manor, housing generations of noble dead? Madness. Until now.
	“I always believed The Woman’s tales, I am happy they bear some credence.” Pjorlar said with a grin. Kyllar grunted, shouldered his pack and trudged across a seemingly endless plane, where only the mighty barrows, plundered of their treasure many years ago, broke the horizon.
Woja was glad her sister had joined her on this venture. Though her grumbling was tiresome, the litter bearing their mother’s body was more that she could have managed by herself.  In the few days they had been together, Woja had noticed changes in her sister, her ever flowing skepticism in her mother’s past had seemed to dry up. Their daylong journey across the Barrow Lands had brought her to tears.  That had been the first great revelation.  The second had been the procession of spirits they watched glide across the waters as they waded from the island to Ur’s mainland. The latter, the Scire could never explain.

“I don’t understand,” Soja had said that evening, as the sister suns, the girls namesakes sank below the horizon, Woja, pale and strange, followed by Soja bright and fiery. “The explorers father sent before we were born never told of this land. They said they found nothing but endless ocean.”
“Our step father kills those who fail him, and they failed. They were frightened, so they did not tell the truth of their defeat. Did mother ever tell you of the defilement of the barrows?”
“No.”
Woja began. She told of the airships and the men who ransacked their ancestor’s precious riches. Of their mother who snuck aboard and struck a fatal blow to the flag ship, of a sprit storm that tore the fleet apart. The two remaining ships returned home, the vessels consigned to scrap, the crews, terrified of reprisal from their Jarl, bound to an oath of secrecy. 

When she had finished, she watched Soja stare into the flames of their campfire. A procession of cold moons, like the sprits they had witnessed earlier that day, chased each other across the night sky. Woja stood and walked to where land ended. She looked across the waters to the Barrow Lands. On those distant shores a campfire burned. Pjorlar and Kyllar no doubt. She smiled, her sister had been less discreet with her markings than she thought. Kyllar was here no doubt to save his neck, and reclaim his wayward charge, Pjorlar to reclaim his love. Brave, stupid Pjorlar. He would make a good husband one day. He had always believed her mothers stories.  She liked that about him. With sudden inspiration, she wadded out into the sea towards the distant shore of the Barrow Lands. 

Night was falling and the pines were growing thick. Kyllar swore as he hacked away at the reaching branches with a small hand axe.  Pjorlar had been unusually grim all day and it was bothering him to no end. There had been none of his songs, or usual fooling. Something had happened last night after he had fallen asleep. Before, they had sung songs and danced about the fire, quite drunk. Perhaps a throbbing head ailed him.

They camped in a clearing they found after tunneling with axe and sword through a particularly vicious patch of brambles, a guttering oil lamp their only source of light. It was a strange patch of ground, a near perfect circle with a wall of brambles all about. It reminded Kyllar of a pen, for some kind of animal. There was a hole in the ground at the center of the clearing, with a stream running into it. Neither of them liked the looks of it. It was deep, for the water made no sounds where it landed somewhere below. 

The two men were asleep when the Jortuuk crawled from the blackness of the pit. It was hungry, but not enough to eat the flesh of a man. It breathed deep of the air, there were mothers near. Not with child, but they would do. It turned from the slumbering figures and loped through the tunnel made in the brambles. They had freed him, and would awake to the dawn, never knowing what they had unleashed upon the lands of Ur.

“Beware, my little stars”
They both heard the voice born upon pine scented winds.
“Mother,” Soja whispered then shook her head. No, she was dead, her body wrapped and motionless upon the litter. Woja set her end down quickly and rummaged through her satchel. Her hand returned clutching The Fang. With deft motion she twisted free The Tooth and attached the new, longer spear head to the shaft. Soja, also feeling the approach, set her side of the litter down, un-shouldered her rifle and loaded it. 

No sooner had she raised the weapon to her shoulder that it appeared between the trees. A kaleidoscope of forms comprised of vileness and malignancy, a thing of teeth, eyes and tongues, circling slowly from tree to tree, waiting for its moment. 

Soja’s finger twitched, the rifle’s hammer snapped forth sending the flint home. The shot bellowed from the barrel and sank into the soft bark of a tree a meter from The Jortuuk. It leapt. Woja slashed with her spear. It cut strange flesh. A resounding scream forced both girls to their knees with hands over ears. 

The Jortuuk chuckled. The part of it that had once been human urged the monstrous rest back into the woods, but that other, ravenous half refused to listen. It crawled, its twisted, fleshy mouth close to the earth, ready to taste flesh. Then it heard familiar words, words of horror and pain from long ago. Words that seemed to flutter as moths, and to which no amount of swiping or batting of mighty arms could repel. 

At the center of The Fang, a glow blossomed into a blinding flower of light. Woja stood, spear raised above her head, The Fang bright as a star. The Jortuuk cowered before the mighty, purifying refulgence. Woja struck.

Soja had wondered how her sister knew the path to their destination. Their mother’s sprit was with them, aiding them on their journey. She had warded off that creature with runes of banishment, given power to The Fang. Even now Woja muttered quietly, but this conversation had another party, and it wasn't Soja. 

The trees about them were converging, weaving. Bark surrounded them. A rooted cathedral. At the end of this tunnel, the light of morning streamed.
The dawn found them trudging through a vast marsh. Soja took up a song. Woja stopped for a moment, realizing it was something their mother had once sung to them, so long ago. 
“Surely you would rather sing one of fathers battle hymns,” She said.
“You mean step father’s?” Soja answered, pushing her end of the litter forward, forcing Woja to continue their march toward the imminent mountain range towering before them, white and gold in the early morning light. Soja took up the song once again, and Woja joined in. 

Kyllar heard the singing from afar. Pjorlar would have taken it up too, had he not disappeared that night in the clearing. Kyllar doubled his pace, gods he was old.
No matter the season, the crossing was a dangerous one. Pjorlar had killed a large beast at the timberline. It’s flesh, smoked over a fire, filled his pack and would sustain him, while it’s wooly hide would ward off the mountain’s cruel chill. Thoughts of Woja kept up his spirits, though guilt of leaving Kyllar gnawed as well.

It had been many nights ago that she had appeared at the fireside of their camp on the Barrow Lands, her pale skin a-glow like an ember. Kyllar snored loudly on the other side of the fire, sleeping the sleep of the drunk. She had slipped under Pjorlar’s fur with him, her skin cold and shivering, her clothes wet with seawater. He held her and chided his love for running away, but soon understood the honor of Woja’s task. Her request of him however, was not so easy to accept. A parting kiss and a promise bound his heart to hers. He watched her wade off into the ocean.

The Spine was a maze of ice and rock, a glacial labyrinth, a trap of cold stone and bottomless crevasses. Yet despite this, he never felt waylaid, it was as if the wind or something residing within guided his steps. One day, after following a down slope he found himself at the edge of a cliff. Far below stretched a land of golden trees and glittering streams. 
“Go to the golden land south of the great mountain where my aunt resides and rules. Await me there,” Woja had whispered that night so many days ago. Pjorlar adjusted his pack and rifle and made his way down, singing a song his love had taught him.

“You old fool!” Soja barked at Kyllar as they sped through the woods. Woja led them at a break neck pace through the forest. Kyllar’s breath came in sharp, wheezing gasps. If he survived, he would put away his smoking pipe forever. Close behind them, The Lost followed. A throng of tumbling forms, crimson eyed and mouthed, urged forth by a lust for new flesh to inhabit. 

Kyllar was never a curious man, and it hadn’t been curiosity that had led him to enter the small stone building, but necessity. The rain had lashed him for days. Cold, wet, alone and with no end in sight, his sanity close to the breaking point, a nights rest in a dry place seemed an unfathomable luxury.

He had been sitting there contentedly, with a small fire and a pipe when Woja appeared at the door. He stared at her with disbelief. The gall of the girl! To lead him along these long months, only to suddenly appear at her leisure! A look in his eye stopped him from speaking. There was terror there, and she was not looking at him, but behind him. He turned and looked into the darkness finding himself staring into a face. 

That face would haunt him for years to come. He had leapt and ran from the stone hut, charging past Woja, bellowing a guttural scream. He ran headlong into Soja who swore as they both tumbled to the ground. Forms began to pour from the door of the little building, more than the structure could have possibly held within. A firm hand grasped Kyllars arm and pulled him into the woods. They watched the figures spin and dance, a nightmare music issuing from unhallowed throats. Then the festivities were over and the hunt began.
The Lost surrounded the lake, but could come no further. This was not a place for those between life and the great sleep. The lake was shallow and they walked the length of it, fog hovering over the surface and shrouding the glowing eyes, mouths, and twitching limbs at the lakeshore.

A mighty and twisted tree appeared out of the mists. Woja knew their journey had ended, for this was the barrow of the all mothers. Kyllar stood at a distance saying nothing. He felt that to break the silence here would be to sin yet again against the law of this strange land.

The twins set the litter down and placed their mother at the trees roots.
“Goodbye mother,” Woja said, uncovering her mother's face and kissing the exposed forehead. Tears streamed freely down Soja’s cheeks but she said nothing. Woja took up a song her mother had been teaching her during their long trek. The spirits of all those who resided there took up the song, a chorus of whispers permeated from the mist. By the songs end, the body was gone. Dawn lifted the gloom of that place and scattered The Lost back to the shadows.

“Goodbye my stars,” their mother said. Soja gasped. Their mother had appeared, as had an earthen portal between the great trees roots. Through this the specter stepped, looked back once at her daughters, then, as a candles flame is snuffed out, both woman and door vanished.
""Mother,"" Soja finally managed, ""am I strong?"" 
The answer came as if from across a great distance, ""you are the strongest.""

As did the fog that surrounded Kyllar, obscuring what had transpired. When its last wisps dispersed only Soja stood there, her face streaked with tears.

Fear, a feeling, is it real? So nostalgic too, it just puts the dark on you
another sand down, the hands of oil are peeling, 
and from the sun, restraint to just throw the shade on you
another cell now is a chance to, is attempt to, and is trying to recall
but you’re never going to touch me
and if I ever manage to get out, it’s all this waking life - just drags me down

a life spent uneasy, in pieces always in pieces here
a life rent completely, release me away from fever dreams

Fear, a friend, without context it’s reeling - you’re never going to pay enough to do right
the veil is a thread and now it’s raising like the tension of a string that just plays the note high
and if I ever really make it out it’s all this waking world that drags me down

a life spent uneasy, in pieces, always in pieces here
a life left - release me away from fever dreams

you're sleeping in the glass room, in the glass house- is a memory now
is a memory to me
don’t you know this shift is real?
you move to lay your body down, the hands of oil are like some small machines
never knowing how to feel, pushing air inside your tired mind and sleeping it 
trapped in fever dreams

a life spent uneasy, in pieces, always in pieces here
a life rent out completely, release me away from fever dreams
don’t lift up your hands, it’s only a warning
like blood in the sand, a kiss is a bruise is endurance
for then felt the falling collapse and held in a small room of hell
don’t lift up your face, it’s all tangled in, it’s always unraveling
for control of, to control it, in controlling, to control it
in time growing tall, had outlined the realms left to seal them
we knocked back the gold, hoping another one could heal them
for when did the faulting collapse come back to just kiss your face
we raise up the glass, it’s only the Devil you know, it’s only the Spirit you taste
for control of, in controlling, to control it
a silver line, nobody born bad, no twin of mine left standing
take clear at dawn and dark into dusk, a habit formed in wandering
a pass, a turn, a season now lost, some badge to earn, some heavy cost
a horn, a tusk, an animal wild, no twin of mine still standing
could control it, in control of, for control of, to control it
run little sister, run so fast, I see he’s gaining on you
take a breath and make it last
the darkwater horizon
smile like you mean it
and just cast the light of hell right out of here
no one else can see it, the shape that makes you fall on fallow ground
so no more laying down, and no more dragging out
it’s the darkhorse you give legs to, no one else can ride
in the wake of strange beginnings, we can still stand high
sing a song, a verse unhinged, passed down from our mother
take breath and make it count and learn to sing another
try ‘cause we need to and laugh the life of hell right out of here
no one else can see him, the shape that makes you fall on fallow ground
so lay your burden down in the springtime that surrounds you
it’s the darkhorse we give legs to, no one else can ride
in the wake of strange beginnings, we can still stand high
it’s you and, you and I lie
it’s the darkhorse we give legs to, that I am proud to ride
in the wake of weak beginnings, we can still stand high
it’s you and I. you and I still try
off to the races and I let ride, what’s changed us in our time
I’ll take the wheel but it’s the hunger that drives and fades us and our kind
sometimes this place is a prison and sometimes a palace, I’ll be the king in my crown
and sometimes the blood and the love is what I’m drinking of
I’m going to drag through the whole town
everyday I’m fading away again, It’s my kind
every night I come back to life again, it’s my time to shine
all fire, all fire, all fire on me, just standing in the sun
and off to the races, I’ll let it slide, all fire in our time
sometimes your love is the thing that I, is the blood that I’m just drinking though towns
and sometimes the night is a prison and sometimes a palace
I’m still the king in my own crown
everyday I’m fading away again,it’s my kind
every night you know I come alive again, it’s my time to shine
and everywhere you..I’m going to find, and everything we...
Nothing’s going to stop us
in a place so loud we will never be free
just a slave to a taker, to a man, to a need
and I won’t go back, I never wanted to leave
just a slave to a taker, will we never be free?
in a city so callus, with two dead set eyes
with a mouth full of xans and a handful of time
they say what doesn’t kill you will just keep you alive
and what doesn’t kill you...
in the place you love with all the dogs set free
in a future together was never going to be me
just a slave to a taker, to a man, to a need
and I can never go back, I never wanted to leave
in the city so callus with two dead set eyes
With a mouth full of xans and a handful of time
they say what doesn’t kill you will just keep you alive
and what doesn’t kill you...
always the long way home
In the city, so callus, with two dead set eyes
With a mouth full of xans and a handful of time
They say what doesn’t kill you will just get high
And what doesn’t kill you...
I outlive the day I outrun the night
hoping he is waiting to dress me all in white
and it feels light
wade out in the water now with you my love
there’s nothing like the feel of it and you
we outshine the sun, we outrise the moon
and if you’ll be here waiting, I’m coming to you soon
and it feels light
wade out in the water now with you my love
there’s nothing like the feel of it and you
lay back in the water black with you my love
crown my love with flowers, I crown my love with light
to lay back in the water dressed up all in white
what Devil, what shape is shifting now?
what lover, which friend pulled back and how
into another grey year and from another cracked face as I have?
a wish for some erasure is surely coming close, if nothing else ever has
I cannot go anywhere without you following
I’ll never know anything without you following
just rest, just lay on future’s dunes
once was a wild smile, once was a wander sad barking at the moon
all across the body the lines of both expressions are stationed now for real
the glaze of tried companions have built upon the senses so dense it cannot feel
what you are is all I have wanted to be
where you are is nowhere and nothing and never free
another day is done another day is gone for me
impetuous girl, what you don’t know can’t hurt you
wish they wouldn’t come back around here no more
but you say “I’ll get you yet”
they are crass, all the people in towns, are falling out and falling down and falling
wish I would’ve come back here less as a boy dressed up as girl dressed all in colors
and how you will sing to them, and how your pain will fall
and how you’ll sing to them, singing it:
“la la la la la la la la la lah ”
you don’t have to cry anymore
all the prettiest worlds...don’t cover them all up in your mind
as you paint, as it should’ve been, you were meant to love
you could not live without it
and in your heart and in your lines
you’ve worked so hard and you’ve lived so kind, been out there just falling down
wish they wouldn’t come back for my boy dressed as a girl dressed all in colors
and how you will sing to them and how your verses fall

When I Was a COP

 It would have been a Short Career.
The best time and the worst
I Love, I Love Me Some ""E Ticket"" Rides
But this one I May not Survive.

They Tell me Not, Not to push
They tell me not to tell tales.
They tell me Not to get used to
The Bad guys staying in Jail!

Every time a car takes off,
I Do everything to make it stop.
I Pit Em, I Pit them way on off the road
Until they end up on thier top!

When wife or child is hurt
I hurt back with legal force.
I try to square, Square up the deal
Because of the pain those people feel.

I Get called in all the time
For the claims I've caused over time.
All the Cruisers I have wrecked
and All the Bad Guys I have decked!
Spoken Word (Well, He Had It Com'in)

CHORUS
It Would be a short Career
The shortest of my life.
I had way too much fun
when they gave me a badge and a Gun.

It's become all too clear to me
that I can't deal with me that way.
When I see the things I See
(Fill in BREAK)
On this Job out here every day!

I Can't Seem To Get To You

I want to hold you tight
When I'm with you at night.
But no matter what I do,
I can't seem to get to you.

I watch everything I say,
And I go out of my way.
But no matter what I do,
I can't seem to get to you.

I can't get around all your guards,
'Cause they're too mean and hard.
And I can't break down your walls
'Cause you've built them too tall.

You say no, that's not true, 
but no matter what I do.
I can't seem to get to you
But I'll keep on trying to.
And perhaps someday,
My dreams will come true.

I cry, and I try, and and I Cry, And I Try, til I'm blue. 
But no matter what I do,
It's just not good enough 
Because I can't get with you.

I want to hold you tight
When I'm with you at night.
But no matter what I do,
I can't seem to get to you.

I Cross My Heart""
(Original Cover)

Our love is unconditional, we knew it from the start.
I see it in your eyes, you can feel it from my heart.
From here on after let's stay the way we are right now,
And share all the love and laughter that a lifetime will allow.

Chorus: 
I cross my heart and promise to
Give all I've got to give to make all your dreams come true.
In all the world you'll never find a love as true as mine.

You will always be the miracle that makes my life complete,
And as long as there's a breath in me, I'll make yours just as sweet.
As we look into the future, it's as far as we can see,
So let's make each tomorrow be the best that it can be.

Chorus 

And if along the way we find a day it starts to storm,
You've got the promise of my love to keep you warm.
In all the world you'll never find a love as true as mine,
A love as true as mine.",2,0

Turtle came up from the depths of the ocean
Rising from the ocean was a giant dolphin, Miyapunu.

Crying tears while singing the song
From the faraway land of Burralgu
Waters spurt from her head
She hit herself against the waves
Swaying to and fro
Travelling through the still waters
So nice and calm.

Slowly and calming, singing,
""I am Djilwuywuy Turtle, I am Guykarri.""
Diving silently through deep water
Towards the great ocean
This Dolphin is carrying. 
She has a child.

Swimming, swim faster
I stray too far from your heart.
Calling through water
Will you hear me? Come find me.
Swim through the water
I'm too small, the Ocean's larger.
Catch me. I'm drowning.
I thought you were beside me.
Whispered listenings
'Round a corner
Shifting mysterings
Silent murmurs
Wade through hearings 
Wild uncovered
Secrets glistening
Caught in my -
 
Slowly, sudden
Rippling, rustling
Ancient hissings
Future rumblings
Clear a little moment
Hear its colour
Hold a little moment
Wait for my - 

Glipse of magic
Maybe, wonder
Can't remember
Maybe thunder
Thoughts that amble
Voices flutter
Would I hear you?
Sleep, sleep, my child, sleep, sleep.
Sleep, sleep, my little one, sleep, sleep.

Gayku the hanging cloud
Floats above the thick Rainforest
Hanging there in a sweet, deep sleep.
The spirit goes up high
To the clouds that hang
The clouds known as Gayku.

Sleep now,
Under the Wulminda tree
Thick foliage provides a cool, dark shade.
Sleep under the shade
Of the Wulminda tree
Then say, ""It has become night"".",11,3

Creceran tus alas

Cantor de la noche
Fugaz me abrazaste
Con alas de luz y de libertad
He caminado hacia el núcleo de la Tierra
Corazon de barro
Corazon de todo pueblo

Mis pies en el suelo de esa Tierra antigua
De nuestros abuelos
Sagrados ancestros

Ahi… iii… ee…

Las plantas del bosque cubrieron mi cuerpo
Entre en lo profundo
Renaciendo

La copa del árbol abrazo el cielo

There are girls like lions
So fierce and brave 
They roam the savannah 
and their courage never wanes,
While I roam the fields 
Trying to emulate their manes 
I'm sure they see right through me 
But I'm gonna try anyway

Although I wander aimlessly
There's comfort in knowing
I could be the one to set my soul free
I'm not yet a lion 
But one day I could be

There are girls like owls 
So calm and wise 
And with a subtle confidence 
They take off and claim the skies 
Whilst I clutch my wings 
And pray one day I'll fly 
Perhaps they'll fly beside me
And give me the strength to try

Although I wander aimlessly
There's comfort in knowing
I could be the one to set my soul free
I'm not yet an owl 
But one day I could be

I can be anything I want to be
Anything I want to be mine can be mine 

I can go anywhere I want to go 
Anything I want to know I know I'll find out 

There are girls like lions 
So fierce and brave 
The owls fly above them 
And their power sends a tidal wave 
And I'll find my place 
Show my strength in different ways 
Respecting all or differences 
We'll set the world ablaze 

Although I wander aimlessly
There's comfort in knowing
I could be the one to set my soul free
I'm not yet an owl 
But one day I could be",12,0

I’ve had my eyes on you for awhile and though
it seems the time isn’t right I know
you want the love that I’ve got to give

we laughed and kissed til the sun took us by surprise 
telling the whole truth about our lives
I’m so in love with that you’ve got to give

I can show you that love is the cure for heartache
let me show you baby, don’t be afraid of a good thing
I can show you that love is the cure for heartache

you think your heart needs to hurt for awhile longer
live all alone til it makes you stronger
learn who you are without her love

I know, I’ve been there before but I won’t wait
for a love like yours I can’t hesitate 
stay awhile and let me change your mind

I can show you that love is the cure for heartache
let me show you baby, don’t be afraid of a good thing 
I can show you that love is the cure for heartache
I know it by heart
but I still like to read it from the start
offering a remedy
sweeter than he used to be 

spend the love we saved, soon
win the waiting game, soon

I hope you’re the same
though I’ve seen everything around me change
refuge in the memory 
sweeter than the truth to me

spend the love we saved, soon
win the waiting game, soon

hold on a little longer
tired hands growing stronger
hold on a little longer
waiting for you
silly dancing 'round the house
laughing who knows what about
wine and popcorn before bed, look to the light

always craving something sweet
always doing something for somebody 
every time that I turn around, I look to the light

to see 
you smiling back at me

oh you’re with me all the time
everything I do 
you’re always on my mind
you’re in every part of me

oh I know that I traveled too far
never wanted to break your heart
believe, you’re the one that gets me through I look to the light

nobody’s ever gonna love me the way you do
I know, it’ll always be the truth
every time I lose myself I look to the light

to see 
you smiling back at me 

oh you’re with me all the time
everything I do 
you’re always on my mind
you’re in every part of me
please baby, don’t you leave for you all of my shit can wait
we’ll push it all aside and we can share a hideaway

please baby, don’t you leave for me all of your shit can wait
we’ll push it all a side and we can share a hideaway

I’ll say anything to make you stay
I just wanna lay the day away
you can’t leave now, we’ve only had a taste
of heaven here in your embrace

no matter what I’ve got to do 
there’s always time, time for you
no matter what I’m going through 
there’s always time, time for you 
there’s time for you, there’s time for you
I hate you make me nervous
I always say the wrong thing
it doesn’t matter anyway
ain’t nothing gonna change, no

I hate the situation 
I’m always running in to you
and when I don’t I’m hoping to 
I hate feeling so confused

don’t wanna feel the way I do, it’s just what I’m going through
don’t wanna feel the way I do, it’s just what I’m going through

I hate that you’re perfect
no way your ass comes up so clean
somebody’s playing tricks on me
can’t see what I wanna see

I hate that you still call me
just when I done made up my mind
to leave your perfect ass behind
I hear you sounding so fine

don’t wanna feel the way I do, it’s just what I’m going through
don’t wanna feel the way I do, it’s just what I’m going through

don’t wanna feel the way I do, it’s just what I’m going through
don’t wanna feel the way I do, it’s just what I’m going through

how else can I let you go
when the man I know
makes me wanna be your girl
outliving the love I saved
fighting dreams away
oh I wanna be your girl 

I hate that I can’t tell you 
left guessing if you’ll ever know
and trying not to let it show
mind games just to let you go

I hate that you don’t want it 
I hate that I’m still so sweet
as if it might change something
when you’re ready you’ll remember me

I hate I know your birthday 
I know all of your favorite shit
when you were talking I was listening
yet I still can’t win

I hate that you don’t call me
I’d like to think that we’re still cool
and now I’m feeling like a fool
every time it rings I hope it’s you 

I was so good to you good to you 
I’d be so good for you good for you 
I know I’m good for you good for you 
because I’m good to you 

I was so good to you good to you 
I’d be so good to you good to you 
I know I’m good for you good for you 
because I’m good to you 

I just wanna be free
you think my love is an open door
no no you can’t come and go as you please
you think my love is an open door
always coming 'round here stealing my peace
you think my love is an open door
keep it up baby, I’m taking away your keys
you think my love is an open door
one day he’s gonna ask you to leave
been trying to 
look the other way
like we never knew love
giving you this space
all I’ve got to say stuck
spinning in my head
I’m done, I’m not gonna pretend no

I should have known it’d be this hard
to let you go, free my heart
the little things drive me insane
I’m not gonna run away no

I’m not gonna run away from our love 
I’m not gonna run away from our love 
I’m not gonna run away from our love 
I’m not gonna run away from our love 

still makes me smile and
I’m not gonna hide it
learn to love what’s left cause
I’m too tired to fight it 
so ready to move on 
but not to forget you baby
you meant something to me, more than something 

I should have known it’d be this hard
to let you go, free my heart
the little things drive me insane
I’m not gonna run away no

I’m not gonna run away from our love 
I’m not gonna run away from our love 
I’m not gonna run away from our love 
I’m not gonna run away from our love
don’t know why I feel this way, it’s been a couple months in the making
but there ain’t no escaping
the doubt scratching at my heart

and though I know that I don’t wanna have to call you up and meet you at some coffee shop
just to find out how you been
lately I’ve been wondering

it’s just a phase, it’s just a phase
I pray it’s just a phase

think back 
think back

back when we were making lists of things we’ve never done, living them one by one
everything so new together
even the weather

coming through with all the little things I like, I don’t remember even telling you
you make me wanna be so good
that you don’t leave me even if you should 

it’s just a phase, it’s just a phase
I pray it’s just a phase

think back 
think back
deeper in to the blue, why do the colors fade
I opened my hands but the sand finds a way to stay
reminding me

coming back home everything breathes a new life, a new life 
visions from now and then turn to a butterfly 

now and then 
remember when 
your path is proof
of strength within
just turn around 

take it in deep, the cold and the evergreens
let it crystalize there inside, quietly in between, remembering

coming back painted with time in another life 
visions from now and then rise to a new light

now and then 
remember when 
your path is proof
of strength within
just turn around
I have traced the dots and back again
searching for some truth
oh the thickest lines point to the end
I know you love me I do

finding bliss in half your heart
defining love as patience art
steady feet will find a way
just keep saying it’s okay

I’m scared of loving you
I tried to stop, but there’s nothing I can do 
I’m gonna give you the best of my love
and pray you change your mind, pray you change your mind

oh a change is gonna come is playing 
loud and strong
and from the way you’re looking at me
how could it be wrong 

happiest and lowest down
uncertainty’s familiar sound
I won’t open up the door
but I can’t take it any more 

I’m scared of loving you
I tried to stop, but there’s nothing I can do 
I’m gonna give you the best of my love
and pray you change your mind, pray you change your mind

I’ve given you so many reasons to stay
showing you the joys of love
and I’ll find another thousand ways
I can I can, and I want to
maybe I’m the fool, maybe I’m the fool

I’m scared of loving you
I tried to stop, but there’s nothing I can do 
I’m gonna give you the best of my love
and pray you change your mind, pray you change your mind

I tried to stop, there’s nothing I can do
I tried to stop, there’s nothing I can do
something turned my love to mystery
you couldn’t hear the things I didn’t say
caught up in dreams of who I want to be
fooled by a feeling that the heart can wait

but love fades
words won’t hold the weight
please stay
show the way you feel

can’t sleep, can’t focus, no I won’t let you go 
I know, I wanna spend my time to earn your love
here it is, let it overflow
finding new ways to show you you’re the one 

cause love fades
word’s won’t hold the weight
please stay
show the way you feel

life feels right, living for the ones you love
up all night, living for the ones you love
can’t help but smile, living for the ones you love
life feels right

life feels right, living for the ones you love
oh I’m up all night, living for the ones you love
can’t help but smile, living for the ones you love
life feels right

cause love fades
don’t you hesitate
show the way, show the way you feel
listen to me cause I’ve told you
I understand the situation 
you came as a sweet surprise, the time was right, no need to
talk through every complication

come on baby don’t stress about it
time will do it’s thing for you and me
every man’s gonna have to compete
with that night at the beach, you know what I mean sugar
still find you looking at me that way, oh and I love it

I know, I know, always have a piece of you in my heart
I know, I know, always have a piece of you in my heart

I won’t be the last to tell you 
what you got to give is so good
I know that I shouldn’t take it, should I take it
oh, every part of me wishes that I could

but I’m not gonna stress about it
time gifted me a memory 
every man’s gonna have to compete
with that night at the beach, you know what I mean sugar
don’t wanna spoil a good thing so I gotta let you go 

I know, I know, always have a piece of you in my heart
I know, I know, always have a piece of you in my heart",13,>1000

I wanna fly with you, over the clouds, you see:
I wanna hide with you
go everywhere with you, if you want me to I’ll go wild with you

ain’t no-one that can touch me, make me go crazy, like you do (just like that)
and I don’t know anyone that I can talk to, no-one wears a smile like you (just like that)
and as the sunset cools, we can wait here for the moon, in purple and blue
you just gotta have patience
and go with the flow
just wanna do my thing
go out to the club ‘till the early morning jump around like ain’t nobody watching
I don’t really care that my baby calling
I just wanna ease my pain
No I blame no-body, no-one, no shame
I wanna move my body, that’s why I came and if you’re not down,
get out of my way

all you want is hype and I don’t want it I just wanna live in the moment
i don’t give a ... ‘bout your money don’t say nothing sweet,
‘cause I ain’t your honey
you won’t listen to me, not even in stereo you want me change, yeah but I don’t think so
‘cause I am super fly, I don’t even have to try
and I don’t need nobody baby
let me tell you why;

I just wanna do my thing
go to the club till the early mornin’
jump around like ain’t nobody watching
I don’t really care that my baby calling
I just wanna ease my pain
No I blame no-body, no-one, no shame
I wanna move my body, that’s why I came and if you’re not down,
get out of my way

no I don’t want it, babe it’s fine
just chilling with my girls - get our way tonight
so step aside and let me by
‘cause I got things to do, it’s my life, never going nowhere anyway with you you’re only there to put me down
I just wanna do my thing
go to the club till the early mornin’
jump around like ain’t nobody watching
I don’t really care that my baby calling
I just wanna ease my pain
No I blame no-body, no-one, no shame
I wanna move my body, that’s why I came and if you’re not down,
get out of my way

Why oh why
you gotta act so cool around me and Don’t know why
you want me to change for you
I had enough of you
Why oh why
you gotta act so cool around me and Don’t know why
you want me to change for you
I did enough for you

I just wanna do my thing
go out to the club ‘till the early morning jump around like ain’t nobody watching
I don’t really care that my baby calling
I just wanna ease my pain
No I blame no-body, no-one, no shame
I wanna move my body, that’s why I came and if you’re not down,
get out of my way
I had a really good time
I had a really really really really really good time

Good time with you (I had a really good time)
I had a really really really really really good time
Good time with you (I had a really good time)
I had a really really really really really good... :)

It’s so beautiful tonight
the moon is up and we feel fine love feels almost real
and when you realise it you
put your phone down
and seem surprised
to see me look you in eye

Don’t write it in a message just say it to my face
and try hard like you mean it wanna hear you say my name

Don’t write it in a message just say it to my face
cause we don’t live forever better recognise real things

I’m trying to have a good time with you (I had a really good time - I had a really really really really really good time)
x2

The blue light from your phone
lights your face up in the room
and you don’t even know
I’m out here trying to get to know you

You’re always online
You’re never about mine
Yo baby I’m trying
to know what’s on your mind

Don’t write it in a message just say it to my face
and try hard like you mean it
wanna hear you say my name

Don’t write it in a message just say it to my face
cause we don’t live forever better recognise real things

Spend time, spend a little while with me I assure you there’s a lot of things to see we could talk or we could walk a little, we could be like real people,
like; do real things
you always gotta be available to everyone you know
I wanna know what’s inside
but I really don’t know

Don’t write it in a message just say it to my face
and try hard like you mean it wanna hear you say my name

Don’t write it in a message just say it to my face ‘cause we don’t live forever better recognise real things

I’m trying to have a good time with you
(I had a really good time)
I had a really really really really really good time
I’m trying to have a good time with you
(I had a really good time)
I had a really really really really really good time
Doesn’t it look like rain? Whenever you go away
I notice the sky turns grey

the covers are still warm from where you’ve been lying, such a shame
I never will sleep again

You don’t know where you stand
there’s always something new with you can’t make you understand
but I can see you want it too
maybe you’l come around and be my boo

I’m a little bit down
I'll put it aside and
take a hit
you won’t let me hide it get a grip
I’ll let this one slide and have you all night and give you just a little bit

Come tell me how you want it
The night is young so there's a little bit left of it
do right by me
you’re always down,
so good to me
I tell you to do right by me
see underneath
I really like your company
but sometimes I hide it
like I deny it

when something’s so good it’s hard to do any good
they don’t make them like you anymore,

when all the lights were off
I was your baby
but I know your lies when I hear them still we try to hide how we’re feeling
So, we are alone in my room I’m putting my phone down nobody trying to reach us on a sunday afternoon

just us, up to no good just us, up to no good just us
just us

I wanna get
intimate witcha
do you mind
if I take it there
put your guard down if you want it baby

just answer your phone, damn

Only time I hear the sound of your voice “Please leave a message after the tone” hey, it’s me again, don’t mean to insist but...

You sit back in your blue car, with your window all the way down,
you never cared for the radio
but you picked out what you know I like you don’t say much

You can’t blame me,
I know your temper, baby
there was a fire in your eyes full of love in the beginning
now I’m trying to visualise what it looked like for a minute

So I’ll see you around

The only time I hear the sound of your voice
“Please leave a message after the tone” Hey, it’s me, can you call me when u get this

Only time I hear the sound of your voice “Please leave a message after the tone” hey, it’s me again, don’t mean to insist but...
I hope you get this

Chorus:
I’m takin' it easy
Just takin' my time
I’ve got my eyes upon the road
I pay no mind to what’s behind 
Don’t know where I’m heading
And I don’t mind
I’ve got my ducks in a row
And my stars in a line
I’m fine.


Damani:

Easy like Sunday mornin 
The night before
It was pourin 
As i set out for the day wit no plans 
Clear sky’s no grey 
In sight 
My insight tells me to catch a train 
& just ride the wave of the rhythm of the tracks 
Observe, sit back & relax 
I’m lookin out the window 
My imagination in tact 
Lookin within 
I’m lookin to spend the day 
Adventuring out 
Whatever the route 
Natural guide 
The map’s inside
It’s a seat open next to me 
If you let go of your pride
Let the rest just be 
Let’s just be 
Let’s just see 
Who knows 
The road traveled is the best for we
The road less traveled is the best retreat 
When it happens natur- ally 
Let’s just see 
Let’s just see let’s just see
No need to speed............ 
let the rest just be 

Camille:

Such a long way to go
But I feel like I’m already where I’m posed to be 
(Be)
Light coat for the winter breeze
Notepad full of subtleties 

But Seems like I’m always in transit 
mental roadblocks I get passed em
Fascinated by the people who pass me 
And they patterns 
Everything on the fly .....

Living in full color 
I’m expanding my palette
I’m stamped with need to discover 
The new 
And uncover the truth 
Its amazing what time traveling do 
To the overall being 
Im just being still
everything is fleeting
But self and piece of home is always worth keeping 
So Let’s link 
Earl grey to match the day 
coordination 
To a tea 
I’m grown now but still playing hide and seek
Ain’t it sweet 
I’ll see you next week
V1
We all wanna eat the cake,
But nobody wants to die,
Nobody wants to jump,
Cause no one knows how high.

We all wanna go both ways,
But nobody can decide,  
We all want the real McCoy,
But the furthest we seem to get is the Four by Five.

We all want a little love,
But a little love is in short supply,
We’re forever beating around the bush,
While the garden’s getting drought dry.

We all need a little grease,
Be it for the wheel or for the hand,
We swallow the bitter pill,
Though for what reason we never understand


CH1	
I probably wouldn’t wager my freedom,
For people basing life offa TV shows,
Folks are living life by the needle,
Is it just me, or is that just the way it goes?
Heaven knows… 


V2
Franklyn…

Penny for my thoughts get your wallets out,
Plenty people posing all they want is clout,
There’s danger, disaster and there’s a lot of doubt,
Blowing cali just to cope it’s got us cotton-mouthed,
So many questions unanswered man only heaven knows,
How much time that I’ve wasted and how much bread I’ve blown,
How many tears I’ve shed, prayers I’ve said for my friends on road,
It was December cold, 
All this stress I hold,
But I see the bigger picture so I’m keeping focused,
I’ve been chasing these figures but it’s just freedom tokens,
Look how this wicked system got my people hopeless,
I want that whip without the roof me while there’s people homeless,
Gotta starve the distractions and try and feed the focus,
I’m about that action not a peaceful protest,
The more I reflect on our mortality,
The more I accept this is all vanity.

V3
No one knows what they want,
But everybody knows just what they don’t,
Everyone says they will,
But we all know that they won’t.

Gluttony killed the cat,
We all know a cat who got the cream,
While felines are getting fat,
The mice are doing all the work, getting twice as lean.

We all want to know the truth,
But most of us live a lie,
Bitten off more than we can chew
It’s getting hard to deny.

We all wanna tie the knot,
Til we get a case of the cold feet,
We all say we’ll take the shot,
Til we’ve got the gun in hand, and we’re in the heat.


CH3
I probably wouldn’t wager my freedom,
For people basing life offa TV shows,
Folks are living life by the needle,
Is it just me, or is that just the way it goes?

Kids are out there facing their demons,
Never had the chance for dream to grow, 
People getting locked up for treason,
When all they wanna see is the truth exposed,
Heaven knows…

Said I would walk on the moon,
They used to say I’d be a heartbreaker,

V1: Alfa Mist

Before reality descends
Before they burn the
Let the anarchy avenge
Let me indulge in the fallacy of men
To whom the end of the fantasy depends
I used to love her she was casually a friend
It was cliche I had to see the trend
That was there since the days of adam and even then 
I was still kinda sad to see it end 
Dealt the losers hand 
School days me and you began 
Year 9 but we speak of future plans
I was caught up in being superman 
I thought I could sort everything in my life by 
When i was young i was blind to any sign
Fast forward i saw you again we spoke of better times 
You told me I promised a wedding ring
I said I used to say many things
I mean remember when…

We grew up on the outside 
Never quite fitting in with the crowd and the limelight 
Every night we’d go out but we’d come back early
We never really got the vibe right
In my mind it was just a game,
Whether we threw down or lost out, it was all the same,
We’d still come home to the front porch and play double dutch til the birds stopped singing their song 
And the light got low 
And the words in my head stopped spinning way off
And the blood in my heart stopped beating real fast and got real slow
Cause I know now no matter what’s up or down
I’ve always got you, and you know you got me too

Maybe I woke up to soon…

Outro
a)
They come and go and seem to stay…
…by night and gone by day,
Each time we’re close they fall away, away, away, away, away.

b)

Dark days lead me down the road to nowhere,
Pathway’s hidden but it’s out there somewhere,
Stargaze take me down the rabbit hole,
Maybe Alice knows how, how far it goes down.",3,0

That's how we do
Search confirmations, authentications
No need no trouble your trust will redouble
And I'll be true to you
Rumors go farther, go deeper, go faster
Wispers and buzz like mosquitos at dawn
They wake me up at 5 in the mo
And I try to squash them
But they keep on drone

Lies spread quicker than the truth

They will never know me like you do

Always
You walk into my room 
And you light it up

Whenever I hear you name
Now that you're far away 
I just want to see your face

Always
You walk into my room 
And you light it up

I just want to get next to you
Tonight tonight

I wanna hold you tonight

We drew a big hole in the sky
We didn't care how big
We didn't care how wide
And I fell into
I fell in you
And you fell into
You fell in me


So please don't ever say
That you'll go away
No please don't ever say
That you'll go away
Cuz of all the birds in the sky
You're the only one that's making me high

Please don't ever go
Please don't ever let me go
Last night
You entered my heart
And now your shadow is tearing me apart

In my, in my mind
It's all gonna work out
It's gonna work out just fine

Whey can't you say you love me?
Why can't you just say I love you?

Last night I fell in love
And now you're all, all I'm thinking of
In my, in my mind
We're all warm and tucked in tight

Whey can't you say you love me?
Why can't you just say I love you?

Dreams
Dreams last so long now that you're gone

Last night
Nunca me dejes mi amor

Cuando te veo
Nunca cambias
Tu boca sonriendo
No se puede olvidar
Vivis en las nubes
Bailas en mis suenos
Eres el viento que mueve el mar

Eres la luna y eres el sol
No puedo vivir sin tu amor

Cuando me dejas
No se que hacer
Estrano tus hojos
Y el olor de tu piel
Dormis por el dia
En noche sos flor
Nunca me dejes mi amor
Nunca me dejes mi amor

Eres la luna y eres el sol
No puedo vivir sin tu amor

Quemame
PEOPLE
BURN 
YOUR MONEY
Only you

When I wake up in the morning
When I go to bed at night
You're the first thing
You're the last thing 
On my mind
I know we've hurt each other
I know we've done things wrong
But that can't change the fact
That our love is strong
And now we open the door
And now we're walking alone
And I just want you to know
In my heart there's only you

Only you

Want to know you very well
Want to hear your story tell
Want to see you in my bed
Want to see you in my dreams
Want to see you
Want to see you at my door
Want to see you on the floor
Only you

Only you",7,43
