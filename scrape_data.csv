I'm scared that my abilities are gone. I'm scared that I'll f*** this up. And I'm scared of you.\nI don't wanna' start, but I will.\nThis is an invocation for anyone who hasn't begun; who's stuck in a terrible place between 0 and 1.\nLet me realize that my past failures at follow-through are no indication of my future performance. They're just healthy little fires that are gonna' warm up my ass.\nIf my FILDI* is strong, let me keep him in a velvet box until I really really need him.\nIf my FILDI* is weak let me feed him oranges and not let him gorge himself on ego and arrogance.\nLet me not hit up my Facebook like it's a crack-pipe, keep the browser closed.\nIf I catch myself wearing a tutu (too fat, too late, too old), let me shake it off like a donkey would shake off something it doesn't like.\nWhen I get that feeling in my stomach, you know that feeling when all the sudden you get a ball of energy and it shoots down into your legs and up into your arms and tells you to get up and stand up and go to the refrigerator and get a cheese sandwich - that's my cheese monster talking. And my cheese monster will never be satisfied by cheddar, only the cheese of accomplishment.\nLet me think about the people that I care about the most. And how when they fail or disappoint me I still love them, I still give them chances, and I still see the best in them - let me extend that generosity to myself.\nLet me find and use metaphors to help me understand the world around me, and give me the strength to get rid of them when it's apparent that they no longer work.\nLet me thank the parts of me that I don't understand or are outside of my rational control, like my creativity and my courage.\nLet me remember that my courage is a wild dog, it won't just come when I call it. I have to chase it down and hold on as tight as I can.\nLet me not be so vain to think that I am the sole author of my victories, and a victim of my defeats.\nLet me remember that the unintended meaning that people project on what I do is neither my fault, nor something that I can take credit for.\nPerfectionism may look good in his shiny shoes, but he's a little bit of an asshole and nobody invites him to their pool parties.\nLet me remember that the impact of criticism is often not the intent of the critic; but when the intent is evil - that's what the block button is for.\nAnd when I eat my critique, let me be able to separate out the good advice from the bitter herbs.\nThere are few people who won't be disarmed by a genuine smile.\nLet me not think of my work only as a stepping stone to something else, and if it is, let me become fascinated by the shape of the stone.\nLet me take the idea that has gotten me this far, and put it to bed. What I'm about to do will not be that. But it will be something.\nThere's no need to sharpen my pencils anymore, my pencils are sharp enough - even the dull ones will make a mark.\nWarts and all, let's start this shit up.\nAnd, God, let me enjoy this.
