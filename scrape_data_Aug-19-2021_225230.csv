I have a memory 
Of a time and place where history resigned
Now my apology  
All the light came in to fulminate my mind
 
Reach out, reach out 
To all the ones who came before you
Ponder what is right
You and I, in defiance
Speak out, speak out 
The conversation may afford you
Wisdom of the wise
You and I, in defiance
 
And I come from conscience where there is no conjugation
I would rather be a flower than the ocean
And I held myself as something of an innovation
I would rather be devoured than be broken
 
All my life I tried so hard
To separate myself from all
That is and was and will be torn apart
You were running unafraid 
I know you, but I’ve changed my way
You know I take it all to heart
 
Home is where you’ve called my name
I’ve gone as far as the eye can blame
You said love may have lost its way
 
Now my life has been erased
And what I gave, I gave for you
And for myself and for the holy name
You were running unashamed
And yours is mine and all remains         
As nothing ever stays the same
 
Reach out, reach out to all the ones who came before
Reach out, reach out to all the ones who came before
Reach out, reach out and all at once the pain restores you
Reach out, reach out and all at once the pain restores you
All at once the pain restores you
 
I have a memory of a time and place where history resigned
Now in my reverie
For the guiding light that opened up my mind
Oh, lift up your head, boy
Don’t play pretend dead on the floor
Now Harryhausen conceived from a cauldron
Wielding Olympus with eyes on the shore
 
There’s nothing 
There’s nothing 
 
Oh, show me the flow of my life
Bound by Acrisius bronzed in the skylight
Seeking the oracle’s eyes in the night with a sigh
Seriphos greets us with moments of silence
 
There’s nothing
There’s nothing
There’s nothing
There’s nothing
 
Who will arrange my great escape?
Hopelessly I have been torn from this outrage
Tossing and turning uneasy it cost me the cross
Am I at rest or resigned in my chaos?
 
There’s nothing
There’s nothing
There’s nothing
There’s nothing
 
There’s something
It’s the light on your hand
There’s something
It’s the touch of my wristband
There’s one thing
It’s the weight of our wish
There’s one thing
It’s our very first kiss",14,60
